Cuba is much more than an island in the Caribbean. Its history is a
complex tapestry of cultures, revolutions, art, and resilience that
has left a profound mark on the world.

## The First Inhabitants

Before the arrival of Europeans, Cuba was inhabited by indigenous
peoples, mainly the Taínos and the Siboneys. The Taínos developed a
sophisticated agricultural culture, cultivating cassava, corn, and
tobacco — a plant that would eventually transform the global economy.

<InfoBox type="history" title="Fun fact">
  The word "tobacco" comes from Taíno, as do "hammock," "canoe," and
  "hurricane." These words entered Spanish and from there passed into
  many other languages around the world.

## The Colonial Era (1492–1898)

Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on October 28, 1492, declaring it
the most beautiful land human eyes had ever seen. Spanish colonization
radically transformed the island over the following four centuries.

Havana became the most important port in the New World, a mandatory
stopover for Spanish fleets laden with gold and silver. This strategic
position attracted pirates, corsairs, and rival powers, giving Cuba a
turbulent but fascinating history.

<CubanQuote author="José Martí">
  The homeland is agony and duty. It belongs to no one; and if it
  belongs to anyone, it shall be, and this only in spirit, to those
  who serve it with the greatest selflessness.
</CubanQuote>

## The Struggle for Independence

The 19th century witnessed multiple attempts to break free from Spanish
rule. The wars of independence, led by figures such as Carlos Manuel de
Céspedes, Antonio Maceo, and José Martí, forged the Cuban national
identity.

## The 20th Century

The 20th century brought the republic, the revolution, and profound
social changes that continue to define Cuba today. Each era left its
mark on the architecture, culture, and spirit of the Cuban people.
