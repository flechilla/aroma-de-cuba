  - question: "Why is the exile community demanding Raúl Castro's indictment now?"
    answer: "Raúl Castro was the head of the Armed Forces in 1996, and recorded evidence exists of him taking responsibility for the order. The recent capture of Venezuela's Maduro has increased hopes for justice."

This February 24, 2026, marks a somber and politically charged anniversary: **30 years since the regime's shootdown of two Brothers to the Rescue civilian aircraft**. In Miami, the exile community has turned the commemoration into a powerful demand for the criminal indictment of Raúl Castro.

## An Anniversary Shaped by Geopolitics

Unlike previous years, the ceremony at the Brothers to the Rescue Memorial in Opa-locka took place against a shifted regional landscape following the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Diaspora leaders and Cuban-American members of Congress are urging the U.S. Department of Justice to move forward with longstanding criminal complaints against Havana's military leadership.

"If Maduro fell, there is no excuse for Raúl Castro to remain immune for the murder of four citizens who were only trying to save lives at sea," an organization spokesperson declared during the morning vigil.

## The 1996 Crime: An Open Wound

The incident occurred in international waters in the Florida Straits. Two Cuban Air Force MiG-29 fighters fired air-to-air missiles at two unarmed civilian Cessna 337s. The attack claimed the lives of **Armando Alejandre Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales**.

Investigations by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) confirmed that the planes were outside Cuban airspace at the moment of impact. Years later, audio recordings surfaced showing Raúl Castro, then Minister of the FAR, admitting that he had authorized the operation.

## Toward a Formal Indictment?

Legal experts in Miami suggest the Trump administration might be preparing a formal indictment as leverage in its discreet communications with figures within the Cuban system. The strategy of "energy asphyxiation" combined with judicial pressure seeks to force a political transition before the end of 2026.

### Keywords of the Exile Demand:
*   **Criminal Indictment:** First-degree murder charges against Raúl Castro and the Air Force chain of command from 1996.
*   **Targeted Sanctions:** Total pressure against officers involved in the February 24 operation.
*   **Historical Reparation:** Exiles demand that any negotiation with Havana include the formal recognition of this crime.
