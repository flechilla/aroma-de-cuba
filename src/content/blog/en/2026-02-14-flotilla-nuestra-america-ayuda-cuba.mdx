An international coalition of social organizations, unions, and activists is mobilizing to send a **humanitarian aid flotilla to Cuba** that could set sail in March, in response to the crisis caused by the [US oil blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-13-onu-condena-bloqueo-energetico-cuba/).

The initiative, named **"Nuestra América"** (Our America), is coordinated by the [Progressive International](https://progressive.international/) under the leadership of David Adler, who described the mission as "more than a logistics operation: it's a movement."

## A Siege Reminiscent of Gaza

In an interview with [EFE](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/organizador-de-flotilla-con-ayuda-a-cuba-no-podemos-permitir-que-se-normalice-el-asedio-contra-la-isla/), Adler drew a direct parallel between Cuba's situation and Gaza: "We're watching how the siege that deprives a territory of access to food and energy is now being applied to the island of Cuba."

> "We cannot allow the strategy applied in Gaza to be replicated anywhere else in the world. We cannot allow these systematic violations of international law to become normalized."

The comparison is deliberate. Several activists who participated in flotillas to Gaza are involved in the Cuban mission, bringing technical and nautical expertise.

## Food, Medicine, and Diplomatic Pressure

The flotilla will carry **food, medicine, and basic supplies**, but its objectives go beyond the humanitarian. The organizers aim to:

- **Break the blockade** preventing the flow of fuel and goods to Cuba
- **Pressure governments** to fulfill their obligations under international law
- **Build a continental solidarity movement** with the Cuban people

Adler acknowledged the initiative carries "real political risks," given they're going up against "the most powerful country in the world."

## Context: An Island on the Brink

The flotilla comes at a critical moment. Cuba faces [blackouts affecting 56% of the country](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2026/02/14/los-apagones-afectaran-de-forma-simultanea-el-56-de-cuba-este-sabado/) this Saturday, with an energy deficit of 1,711 MW. Last week, [Mexican Navy ships delivered 814 tons of aid](/en/blog/2026-02-13-buques-mexico-ayuda-humanitaria-cuba/), while the [UN condemned the energy blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-13-onu-condena-bloqueo-energetico-cuba/) as a human rights violation.

The [fire at the Ñico López refinery](/en/blog/2026-02-14-incendio-refineria-nico-lopez-habana/) in Havana on Friday worsened the situation further, and [independent experts estimate](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/14/cuba-fuel-shortage-trump-tariffs.html) that $8–10 billion would be needed to overhaul Cuba's electrical system.

## A Civil Response to the Blockade

The "Nuestra América" flotilla joins efforts by Mexico and other countries that have sent aid, but represents something different: **an organized response from international civil society**, not from governments.

With [flights suspended from Canada](/en/blog/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis/), [Russia](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba/), and [Cubana de Aviación cutting routes](/en/blog/2026-02-14-cubana-aviacion-recorta-vuelos-madrid/), Cuba's isolation deepens by the day. The flotilla aims to send a clear message: the Cuban people are not alone.
