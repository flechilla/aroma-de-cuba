Few countries treat a **poster** as high art. Cuba is one of them. Since the 1960s, the island has produced some of the most original, daring, and collectible posters in the world — pieces that now hang in [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/), the [Smithsonian](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/), and private collections where originals fetch thousands of dollars.

We're not talking about commercial advertising. **Cuban posters** were born from cultural revolution — from the need to communicate with zero budget and boundless imagination.

## ICAIC: Where Cinema Became Graphic Art

It all started in **1959** with the founding of the [Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAIC). ICAIC didn't just produce films — it needed to promote them. And in a Cuba without a commercial advertising industry, they gave artists free rein.

**Saúl Yelín**, one of ICAIC's founders, was the visionary who recruited young designers with a simple instruction: *do whatever you want*. No corporate clients to please, no focus groups, no restrictions. The result was an unprecedented creative explosion.

### The Masters of Cuban Poster Art

- **Eduardo Muñoz Bachs** (1937–2001): Born in Valencia, Spain, he arrived in Cuba at age 4. He created over **2,000 posters** for ICAIC. His style — flat colors, humor, simplified figures — is perhaps the most recognizable in Cuban design.
- **René Azcuy Cárdenas** (1939–2009): Master of graphic portraiture and high contrast. His posters for films like *Lucía* are icons of Latin American design.
- **Antonio Fernández Reboiro** (1935–): A radical experimenter who brought psychedelia and op art to Cuban poster art.
- **Alfredo Rostgaard** (1943–2004): Creator of the famous [Canción protesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Rostgaard) poster featuring a rose and nail. His OSPAAAL work defined the solidarity aesthetic.
- **Raúl Martínez** (1927–1995): Pioneer of Cuban silkscreen printing since 1943. His pop portraits of [José Martí](/en/blog/libros-cubanos-literatura-esencial/) and Che Guevara fused pop art with national identity.

### The Technique: Artisanal Silkscreen

ICAIC posters were mostly produced using **silkscreen** (serigrafía), a technique that allowed short runs of 500 to 2,000 copies. Each poster was essentially an original graphic work — hence their current value as collectibles.

The artisanal process — hand-separated colors, vibrant inks, variable-quality paper — gave each print a unique character that industrial lithography could never replicate.

## OSPAAAL: Art as International Solidarity

If ICAIC posters promoted cinema, **OSPAAAL** posters promoted revolutions. The Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America was founded in Havana in **1966** after the [Tricontinental Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricontinental_Conference). OSPAAAL published its *Tricontinental* magazine with a fold-out insert: a **solidarity poster**.

These posters were distributed free to over **80 countries** for decades. They supported independence in Vietnam, Angola, Mozambique, Palestine — any Third World liberation cause. Design was the weapon.

### Most Iconic OSPAAAL Posters

- **"Day of the Heroic Guerrilla"** (Rostgaard, 1968): The stylized Che that became a global symbol.
- **"Nixon"** (Reboiro, 1972): A distorted portrait of the US president, now valued at over $3,000.
- **"Solidarity with Vietnam"** (various artists): A series that defined the anti-war graphics of the 60s-70s.

## Where to Buy and Collect Cuban Posters

### Originals (Investment)

Original ICAIC and OSPAAAL posters are collector's items with prices ranging from **$200 to over $10,000** depending on artist, condition, and rarity.

- **[eBay - Home of the Cuban Posters](https://www.ebay.com/str/homeofthecubanposters)**: The largest store of originals, with inventory classified by decade and type.
- **International Auctions**: [Christie's](https://www.christies.com/) and [Sotheby's](https://www.sothebys.com/) include Cuban posters in their graphic art sales.
- **Lincoln Cushing Archive**: A researcher and collector who has cataloged thousands of Cuban posters.

### Reproductions (Décor)

For those who want the aesthetic without the collector's price tag:

- **[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=cuban+poster+art)**: High-quality reproductions, giclée prints, and framed posters.
- **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cuban+poster+art)**: More commercial selection but accessible.
- **In Havana**: The [Taller Experimental de Gráfica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taller_Experimental_de_Gr%C3%A1fica) in Cathedral Square sells contemporary prints and silkscreens.

### In Cuba

If you visit the island, these are the key spots:

- **Taller Experimental de Gráfica** (Old Havana): Founded in 1962, it still produces original graphic work.
- **ICAIC Gallery** (Vedado): Occasionally exhibits and sells posters from the archive.
- **Havana Book Fair**: A space to find posters and prints from Cuban publishers.

## The Legacy: From Posters to Contemporary Art

Cuba's graphic tradition didn't stop in the 60s. Today, a new generation of designers continues the legacy:

- **Nelson Ponce** and **Giselle Monzón** keep the film poster tradition alive with contemporary aesthetics.
- The [Digital Art Salon](https://www.ecured.cu/Sal%C3%B3n_de_Arte_Digital) has expanded Cuban graphics into the digital realm.
- Collectives named after masters like **Azcuy** train new designers.

Cuban posters prove something few cultural products achieve: they are simultaneously **art, history, and objects of desire**. From a wall in Old Havana to an auction house in London, they still speak with the same visual power they had over half a century ago.
