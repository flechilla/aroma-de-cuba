Cuban handicrafts are among the richest and most varied cultural expressions in the Caribbean. From noble wood carvings to the delicate embroidery of Trinidad, each artisan piece tells a story of cultural blending, creativity and resilience. In this guide, we explore Cuba's main artisan products, their materials, techniques and where to find them.

## Wood Carvings: The Art of Cuban Hands

Cuba possesses world-renowned precious woods — **mahogany**, **cedar** and **Cuban ebony** — that artisans transform into sculptures, masks, kitchen utensils and decorative figures.

The most recognized carvings include:

- **Saint and orisha figures**: reflecting Cuba's religious syncretism, linked to [Santería](/en/blog/santeria-cubana-religion-orishas/)
- **Musician sculptures**: guitarists, percussionists and dancers capturing Cuban rhythm
- **Boxes and humidors**: the tobacco tradition inspires handcrafted carved humidors, the perfect complement to [Cuban cigars](/en/blog/habanos-guia-puros-cubanos-marcas/)
- **Kitchen utensils**: mortars, spoons and cutting boards carved from hardwoods

The main workshops are concentrated in **Old Havana**, **Trinidad** and **Holguín**, where entire families maintain techniques passed down through generations.

## Ceramics and Pottery: Clay with Soul

Cuba's ceramic tradition fuses Spanish, African and Taíno influences. Pieces range from utilitarian tableware to contemporary works of art.

### Main Centers

- **Camagüey**: famous for its **tinajones**, enormous clay vessels that became the city's symbol. Originally used to collect rainwater, today they're iconic decorative pieces
- **Trinidad**: decorative ceramics with colonial and tropical motifs
- **Isla de la Juventud**: pottery tradition with reddish-toned local clays

Contemporary artists like those at the **Taller de Cerámica Artística** in Havana have taken Cuban ceramics to international galleries, fusing ancestral techniques with modern design.

## Basketry: Fibers That Weave Tradition

Basketry is perhaps the most widespread craft in rural Cuba. It uses native plant fibers:

- **Yarey** (*Copernicia yarey*): a palm endemic to Cuba, its leaves are braided into hats, bags and baskets
- **Guano** (*Coccothrinax*): another Cuban palm used for baskets and mats
- **Henequen** (*Agave fourcroydes*): a resistant fiber for bags, hammocks and rope

The **yarey hat** is possibly the most recognizable Cuban artisan product. Used by farmers across the island, it has become a symbol of the Cuban countryside. The best are produced in **Pinar del Río** and **Sancti Spíritus**.

### Popular Basketry Products

| Product | Material | Region |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Yarey hat | Yarey palm | Pinar del Río |
| Jabas (bags) | Henequen | Matanzas |
| Decorative baskets | Braided guano | Villa Clara |
| Hammocks | Henequen/cotton | Camagüey |
| Hand fans | Yarey | Trinidad |

## Leather Work: Cuban Hides

Leather crafting has roots in colonial cattle ranching. Cuban leather workers produce:

- **Saddles and harnesses**: for Cuban cowboys, especially in Camagüey
- **Sandals and shoes**: artisan designs blending tropical comfort and style
- **Belts and wallets**: with engravings of Cuban motifs
- **Machete sheaths**: a classic utilitarian item from the countryside

**Camagüey** is the capital of Cuban leather work, heir to its cattle-ranching tradition. The city maintains family workshops where leather is tanned and worked using traditional methods.

## Textiles: Embroidery, Lace and Drawn-Thread Work

Cuba's textile tradition stands out for its delicacy and patience:

- **Trinidad drawn-thread work**: a technique where threads are pulled from fabric to create openwork patterns. Recognized by [UNESCO](https://ich.unesco.org/) as cultural heritage
- **Hand embroidery**: tablecloths, napkins and garments with floral and geometric motifs
- **Bobbin lace**: a technique of Spanish origin preserved in colonial cities
- **Rag dolls**: colorful figures representing Cuban characters

The artisans of **Trinidad** are especially famous. In the Plaza Mayor, it's common to see women embroidering on porches — an image that has defined the city's visual identity.

## Other Artisan Products

### Musical Instruments
Cuba produces high-quality handcrafted instruments: **claves**, **maracas**, **bongos** and hand-carved **güiros**. Many professional musicians prefer these instruments for their authentic sound.

### Jewelry with Seeds and Natural Materials
Necklaces, bracelets and earrings made from **tropical seeds** (ox-eye, Job's tears), **black coral**, **tortoiseshell** (now prohibited for environmental protection) and **coconut**. Afro-Cuban style jewelry with colored beads representing the [orishas](/en/blog/santeria-cubana-religion-orishas/) is very popular.

### Papier-mâché and Recycled Art
Cuban artists transform recycled materials into art: **miniature classic cars** made from tin cans, **wire sculptures** and **papier-mâché masks** for carnivals.

## Where to Find Cuban Handicrafts

### In Cuba
- **Almacenes San José** (Havana): Cuba's largest craft market, in a former port warehouse
- **Plaza Mayor in Trinidad**: open-air market with the best textiles and ceramics
- **Calle Obispo** (Old Havana): galleries and artisan shops
- **ACAA Fairs** (Cuban Association of Artisan Artists): periodic events across the island

### Abroad
- [EverythingTienda.com](https://everythingtienda.com/): online shop for Cuban artisan products
- **Cuban culture fairs** in Miami, Madrid and Mexico City
- **Etsy**: independent Cuban artisans sell directly

## The Future of Cuban Handicrafts

Cuba's artisan sector is experiencing a moment of transformation. The opening of self-employment has allowed thousands of artisans to sell directly, while social media gives them international visibility. However, access to quality materials and logistical difficulties remain significant challenges.

Organizations like the [Cuban Fund for Cultural Goods](http://www.fcbc.cu/) and community projects work to preserve traditional techniques and train new generations of artisans.

Every piece of Cuban handicraft is a piece of the island: its history, its creativity and its indomitable spirit. Buying Cuban handicrafts isn't just acquiring an object — it's supporting a living tradition that connects past and present.
