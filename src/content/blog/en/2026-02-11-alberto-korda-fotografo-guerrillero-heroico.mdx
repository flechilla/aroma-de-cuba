On **March 5, 1960**, at a massive funeral in Havana, a 31-year-old photographer raised his camera and captured an image that would change the visual history of the 20th century. That man was **Alberto Korda**, and that photograph would become [Guerrillero Heroico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrillero_Heroico), the most reproduced portrait of all time.

## From Fashion Photographer to Revolution's Chronicler

Alberto Díaz Gutiérrez was born in Havana in **1928**, son of a railway worker. Before the Revolution, Korda was known as **Cuba's most prestigious fashion photographer**. In 1956 he founded **Korda Studios** with Luis Peirce, adopting his stage name inspired by Hungarian directors Alexander and Zoltan Korda.

> "My main aim was to meet women," he once confessed about his years in fashion photography.

But the triumph of the Revolution in **1959** completely transformed his life. At nearly 30 years old, Korda abandoned the fashion world to document the changes shaking Cuba.

## The Moment That Captured History

The photograph that would immortalize Che Guevara was taken during the funeral for victims of the **La Coubre** ship explosion in Havana's harbor. Korda was photographing Fidel Castro when, for an instant, Che appeared in his viewfinder.

"There's something about his eyes in the photo. A kind of mystery. His personality comes through," Korda later explained about those **two shots** from his Leica camera.

The image remained in Korda's archives for **seven years**, practically forgotten. It wasn't until Che's death in Bolivia in **1967** that Italian publisher [Giangiacomo Feltrinelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giangiacomo_Feltrinelli) visited Korda seeking images of the revolutionary.

Korda **gave him** two copies of the photograph as a gift. Feltrinelli reproduced it as a poster that sold **one million copies** in six months. The rest is history.

## The Image That Never Paid Him

Contrary to what many believe, Korda **never received royalties** for the most reproduced photograph in the world. Cuba did not recognize the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) on copyright, and Korda never sought to profit economically from the image.

His only lawsuit came in **2000**, when Smirnoff vodka used Che's image for an advertising campaign. Korda won **$50,000** which he immediately donated to Cuba's healthcare system.

> "If Che were still alive, he would have done the same," Korda declared.

## Beyond Guerrillero Heroico

Though remembered primarily for that image, Korda's legacy includes some of the most emblematic photographs of the Cuban Revolution:

- **The Girl with the Wooden Doll** (1958): A girl holding a stick as if it were a doll, an image that convinced him to dedicate his work to the revolution
- **Fidel's Entry into Havana** (1959): The triumphant moment of the guerrillas
- **The Quixote of the Lamp Post** (1959): A man in a straw hat atop a lamp post during a massive rally
- **Militia Woman** (1962): Portrait of a Cuban militia woman

For **ten years** he served as Fidel Castro's personal photographer, accompanying him on trips to Washington, Moscow, and the Sierra Maestra. Among his lesser-known images are Castro playing golf with Che, fishing together, and staring at a tiger in New York's zoo.

## The Artist Behind the Camera

Korda was known for rejecting **artificial lighting**, which he called "a travesty of reality." He worked only with natural light, always seeking **perfect composition** and ideal framing.

This philosophy made him a master of black-and-white photography, capable of finding poetry in the most everyday moments of the revolution.

Between **1968 and 1978** he dedicated himself to underwater photography, another of his passions. A 1978 exhibition in Japan sparked international interest in his work beyond the iconic Che image.

He appeared briefly in Wim Wenders' documentary [Buena Vista Social Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(film)) in 1999, though uncredited.

## Eternal Legacy

Alberto Korda died of a heart attack in **Paris on May 25, 2001**, while presenting an exhibition of his work. He was 72 years old. His remains rest in [Colón Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col%C3%B3n_Cemetery) in Havana.

In **2016**, the Leica camera he used to capture the Che photo was auctioned for **€18,100**.

The documentary **Kordavision** (2006), directed by Héctor Cruz Sandoval, explores his life and was selected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its documentary series.

*Korda's photography transcends the image of Che. It's the testimony of an artist who abandoned glamour to document a revolution, expecting nothing in return. His legacy lives on in every reproduction of that gaze he captured in a fraction of a second more than 65 years ago.*
