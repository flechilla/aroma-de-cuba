faq:
  - question: "How did the fake immigration law firm scam work?"
    answer: "The fraudsters created a firm called 'CM Bufete de Abogados Consultoría Migratoria' and recruited victims primarily through Facebook. They charged hundreds to thousands of dollars and then staged fake asylum interviews and court hearings via video call, wearing judicial robes and law enforcement uniforms and displaying DHS flags and USCIS signs in the background to appear official."
  - question: "Who was arrested, and who were the victims?"
    answer: "Four people were arrested: Daniela Alejandra Sánchez Ramírez (25), Jhoan Sebastián Sánchez Ramírez (29), and Alexandra Patricia Sánchez Ramírez (38) — three siblings caught at Newark airport trying to flee to Colombia — and Marlyn Yulitza Salazar Pineda (24), arrested at a restaurant in New Jersey. A fifth defendant remains at large in Colombia. The victims were Latin American immigrants, including political asylum seekers."
  - question: "What happened to the victims of this immigration scam?"
    answer: "The consequences were devastating. Victims lost money (hundreds to thousands of dollars), believed their cases had been resolved, and missed their real immigration court hearings. At least one victim was ordered deported in absentia for failing to appear at an actual hearing. Others received threatening messages — including deportation threats — when they discovered the fraud."
  - question: "How can I protect myself from fake immigration lawyers?"
    answer: "Always verify that an attorney is licensed through the State Bar of their state before paying anything. Real immigration court hearings are conducted in English. Be wary of anyone who contacts you on Facebook offering immigration services, guarantees outcomes, or asks for payment upfront without showing verifiable credentials. Consult the EOIR's list of free or low-cost legal providers at justice.gov."

⚠️ **WARNING FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY:** A criminal network operated for more than two years in New York and New Jersey, posing as immigration attorneys, federal judges, and government agents. They defrauded dozens of vulnerable immigrants — including political asylum seekers — out of thousands of dollars for services that never existed.

## The Theater of Deception

Between March 2023 and November 2025, five individuals operated a shell firm called **"CM Bufete de Abogados Consultoría Migratoria"** — despite none of them being licensed to practice law in any U.S. state.

Their method was sophisticated and ruthless:

1. **Facebook recruitment:** They placed ads and contacted immigrants searching for legal help, particularly those pursuing asylum claims.

2. **Upfront fees:** They demanded payments ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars for legal representation and immigration processing.

3. **Fake official documents:** They sent documents that appeared official, bearing logos of federal agencies including DHS and USCIS — sometimes referencing the real case numbers of their victims to add credibility.

4. **The centerpiece — fake video hearings:** They staged fake asylum interviews and court appearances via video conference. The defendants wore **judge's robes and law enforcement uniforms**, placed DHS flags and "United States Citizenship and Immigration Services" signs in the background, and conducted all proceedings in Spanish so their victims would feel at ease.

5. **False resolution:** In many cases, they told clients their immigration matters had been "favorably resolved" — when in reality nothing had been done.

## The Consequences: Deportations and Threats

Federal prosecutors described the impact as potentially **"life-altering"** for victims. At least one person was **deported in absentia** — ordered removed without being present at an actual hearing — because they believed the fake firm had already resolved their case and did not appear before the real immigration court.

When one victim discovered the scam and sought legitimate legal counsel, the defendants responded by **sending threatening messages demanding additional payment and threatening deportation**.

In total, the network made **more than $100,000**, laundering tens of thousands of dollars to co-conspirators in Colombia.

## The Arrests: Siblings Caught While Fleeing

Four of the five defendants were arrested on Friday, February 20:

- **Daniela Alejandra Sánchez Ramírez**, 25
- **Jhoan Sebastián Sánchez Ramírez**, 29
- **Alexandra Patricia Sánchez Ramírez**, 38

The three siblings were **arrested at Newark Liberty International Airport** as they attempted to board a one-way flight to Colombia. The fourth defendant, **Marlyn Yulitza Salazar Pineda**, 24, was caught at a restaurant in New Jersey. A fifth defendant remains at large in Colombia.

All five face charges of **wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and two counts of false impersonation of a federal official**.

U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. of the Eastern District of New York was unequivocal: *"The defendants engaged in this criminal conduct entirely because of greed, lining their own pockets and those of their coconspirators in Colombia to whom they laundered tens of thousands of dollars of victims' funds — demonstrating a complete and utter disregard for the potentially life-altering consequences their actions inflicted on vulnerable individuals."*

## Why Cuban Immigrants Are Especially at Risk

This type of scam poses a particular danger to the Cuban community:

- Thousands of Cubans have **active asylum cases and pending applications**, making them attractive targets for fraud of this kind.
- The current climate of intensified enforcement — including [work permit restrictions for asylum seekers](/en/blog/2026-02-21-trump-restringe-permisos-trabajo-solicitantes-asilo), the [I-220A class action lawsuit](/en/blog/2026-02-17-i220a-demanda-colectiva-500mil-cubanos), and widespread uncertainty — creates **desperation and urgency** that scammers exploit.
- The language barrier leads many Cubans to seek representation in Spanish. This ring deliberately conducted all its fake proceedings in Spanish to lower victims' guard.
- Fear of approaching authorities — out of concern about triggering enforcement — leaves many victims without recourse.

Stories like that of [the SUNY Upstate hospital workers](/en/blog/2026-02-22-cubanos-trabajadores-hospital-liberados-ice-nueva-york) illustrate how much can hinge on a single legal process; falling victim to scammers at a critical moment can mean deportation.

## Red Flags: How to Spot an Immigration Scam

Immigration attorneys advise extreme caution if someone:

- **Contacts you unsolicited on Facebook** offering immigration services
- **Demands payment before** showing verifiable credentials or a bar registration number
- **Conducts official hearings over video** claiming to be a judge or federal agent
- **Guarantees a favorable outcome** in asylum proceedings (no one can guarantee results)
- **Only speaks Spanish** during "official hearings" (actual proceedings are in English)
- **Threatens you with deportation** when you question their services or ask for documentation

## Free and Verified Legal Resources

3. **[I-220 Forms Guide](/en/blog/2026-02-11-formularios-i220-cubanos-guia):** If you hold an I-220A or I-220B form, consult our guide to understand your real legal status.
4. **Verify any attorney's bar license** with the State Bar of their state before paying anything.
