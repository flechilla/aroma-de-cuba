February 9, 2026, marked a historic milestone in US-Cuba migration relations: for the first time in decades, **the Cuban regime accepted deportees with serious criminal records** from US territory.

## The flight that changed history

The year's first ICE Air deportation flight transported **170 Cuban nationals** back to the island, including individuals convicted of crimes such as murder, kidnapping, rape, and drug trafficking. This decision by the Cuban government represents a radical shift in their traditional migration policy.

> "Cuba accepts criminal deportees for the first time," confirmed US immigration sources, describing the event as "an unprecedented policy change."

## Why is this so significant?

For decades, **Cuba had systematically refused** to accept back deportees with criminal records, creating a legal limbo for thousands of Cubans detained in the United States. This situation had greatly complicated Washington's deportation efforts.

### The numbers that matter

- **170 deportees** on the first flight of 2026
- **First criminals** accepted by Cuba in decades
- **Thousands of cases** previously blocked by Cuban refusal
- **New cooperation** between both governments

## Trump administration pressure

The change coincides with the intensification of migration policies under the Trump administration. **Marco Rubio** and other officials have exerted diplomatic pressure on the Cuban regime to accept deportees, especially those with criminal backgrounds.

Sources suggest Cuba yielded under **"increased economic and diplomatic pressure"** from Washington, though specific negotiation details remain classified.

## Impact on the Cuban community

This development has profound implications for the **300,000 Cubans** currently with deportation orders in the United States:

### Immediate changes
- Higher probability of effective deportation
- End of the "protective shield" of Cuban refusal
- Acceleration of ICE processes

### Affected cases
- I-220A holders with backgrounds
- Asylum seekers with minor crimes
- Previous temporary protection beneficiaries

## Miami reactions

The Cuban-American community in Florida shows divided reactions to this news. While some **support the deportation of criminals**, others express concern about the precedent this establishes.

**José Martínez**, an immigration attorney in Miami, comments: _"This changes the entire legal landscape for our clients. Cuba can no longer be the shield it once was."_

## International context

This migration cooperation emerges at a time of **complex diplomatic tensions** between Washington and Havana. Despite sanctions and maximum pressure policies, both governments have found common ground on specific migration issues.

### Key factors
- **US economic pressure** on Cuba
- **Migration crisis** in the Caribbean
- **Diplomatic needs** on both sides

## What comes next?

Experts predict this first flight is only the **beginning of a new era** in Cuba-US deportations. The established precedent suggests that:

- **More deportation flights** will follow
- **Cuba will continue** accepting criminals
- **ICE will accelerate** pending cases
- **Migration policies** will tighten

## FAQ: Frequently asked questions

### Why did Cuba change its policy now?

Economic and diplomatic pressure from the Trump administration, combined with the regional migration crisis, forced the Cuban regime to cooperate on deportation issues for the first time in decades.

### What types of criminals were deported?

According to ICE, the flight included people convicted of murder, kidnapping, rape, drug trafficking, and other serious crimes that previously could not be deported to Cuba.

### Does this affect Cubans with I-220A?

Potentially yes. The policy change eliminates a de facto protection that many Cubans had, even those with supervision documents like I-220A.

### Will there be more deportation flights?

Signs point to yes. This first flight establishes a precedent that will likely continue under current Trump administration policies.
