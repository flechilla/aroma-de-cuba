In the heart of **Villa Clara province**, a small colonial city of barely 46,000 residents transforms every Christmas Eve into the epicenter of the Caribbean's most spectacular festival. **Las Parrandas de Remedios** aren't just a celebration — they're an explosion of creativity, friendly rivalry, and community pride that has defied time for over **200 years**.

Since 2018, this tradition has been part of [UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/festivity-of-las-parrandas-in-the-centre-of-cuba-01405), joining [Cuban rumba](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rumba-cubana-patrimonio-unesco/) and the [punto cubano](/en/blog/2026-02-12-punto-cubano-decima-patrimonio-unesco/) as globally recognized cultural treasures.

## Origins: A Clever Priest and Noisy Children

The story begins around **1820** when parish priest **Francisco Vigil de Quiñones** faced a problem: his church was empty for Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. His solution was as simple as it was brilliant: send groups of children through the streets banging pots, pans, and anything they could find to wake the town and drag them to church.

What started as childhood mischief evolved over decades. By **1875**, the Parrandas already had the structure we know today: organized neighborhoods, elaborate floats, fireworks competitions, and the parrandera rumba that sweeps thousands through the streets.

## The Great Rivalry: San Salvador vs. El Carmen

Remedios is divided into two rival neighborhoods that define the essence of the Parrandas:

- **San Salvador** — Symbolized by the **rooster**, colors blue and white
- **El Carmen** — Symbolized by the **hawk** (or globe), colors red and brown

The rivalry is fierce but always friendly. Entire families dedicate the whole year to secretly preparing surprises for the big night. Each neighborhood deploys **spies** who try to discover the other side's plans — a game of intelligence and counterintelligence that adds excitement to the months leading up to the event.

## Anatomy of a Parranda Night

The **December 24th** celebration follows a precise ritual that kicks off at nightfall:

### The Rumba (from 10 PM)

A **palenque** — a firework designed to explode with a surprise bang — announces the start of the first neighborhood's rumba. Musicians emerge with their **atamboras** (a unique local drum found only in Remedios), cowbells, bass drums, and congas. Trumpets, added in the 1930s, complete the sonic arsenal.

The rumba has one purpose: to **drag** — literally — as many people as possible while singing their polka (each neighborhood has its own, with lyrics taunting the rival). When one neighborhood finishes, the other makes its entrance. This exchange repeats several times.

### The Plaza Works

This is the most artistic moment: each neighborhood presents its **carroza** (float), a monumental architectural structure filled with lights, colors, and fantastical decoration. Characters atop the float must remain **motionless like statues** as the structure advances and their legend is read to the public — moving is a dishonor to the neighborhood.

The floats can reach impressive heights and require months of artisanal work. Carpenters, electricians, painters, seamstresses, and craftspeople join forces in secret workshops where Cuban folk art reaches its highest expression.

### The Fireworks

The climax. When the float completes its ceremonial journey (barely **40 meters**), pyrotechnicians deploy lines of rockets stretching **three to four blocks**. Remedios's sky lights up in a battle of light and sound that can last until dawn.

Parranda pyrotechnics is its own art form: local artisans craft their own rockets and designs, passing knowledge from generation to generation.

## Beyond Remedios: 18 Parranda Communities

What was born in Remedios spread throughout central Cuba. Today, **18 communities** celebrate their own parrandas:

- **Camajuaní** — The second most famous, with rivalry between *La Loma* and *La Marina*
- **Vueltas** — Known for their elaborate floats
- **Zulueta**, **Chambas**, **Guayos**, **Taguayabón**, **Calabazar de Sagua**, **Zaza del Medio**, and others

Each town adapts the tradition to its own personality. In **Taguayabón**, for example, float characters perform like actors while the legend is read — an innovation that purists from nearby towns consider a break from classic tradition.

## Living Heritage in Difficult Times

The Parrandas have survived wars, economic crises, hurricanes, and [Cuba's current difficult situation](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/). Their strength lies in being a **truly communal tradition**: they don't depend on government or sponsors, but on each neighborhood's collective ingenuity.

As [UNESCO](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/festivity-of-las-parrandas-in-the-centre-of-cuba-01405) notes: *"All the inhabitants of the eighteen communities concerned take part in the festivities, regardless of sex, age, origin, social background, profession, and religion."*

Artisanal knowledge — carpentry, pyrotechnics, sewing, electrical work, painting — passes from generation to generation. Grandparents teach grandchildren, and rivals respect each other outside the competition. It's cultural democracy in its purest form.

## Cuba's Three Great Festivals

Las Parrandas de Remedios are considered one of **Cuba's three main popular festivals**, alongside:

1. **[Santiago de Cuba Carnival](/en/blog/2026-02-12-carnaval-santiago-cuba-fiesta-mas-antigua/)** — The island's largest festival, with comparsas and congas
2. **Las Charangas de Bejucal** — In Mayabeque province, with its own neighborhood rivalry tradition
3. **Las Parrandas de Remedios** — The most artistic and pyrotechnically spectacular

While Santiago celebrates with eastern Caribbean heat and Bejucal with Havana proximity, Remedios offers something unique: the combination of **monumental ephemeral art** (floats are destroyed afterward), handcrafted fireworks, and a rivalry that structures an entire town's social life throughout the year.

## How to Experience the Parrandas

If you're planning to visit Remedios for the Parrandas:

- **Date:** **December 24th** is the main night, but activities begin from December 16th
- **Accommodation:** Remedios has *casas particulares* and is 45 minutes from Villa Clara's beach keys
- **Arrival:** Get there early; the plaza fills completely
- **Safety:** Fireworks are powerful — keep a safe distance
- **Transport:** About 4-5 hours from Havana by road; Santa Clara is 45 km away

*Las Parrandas prove that Cuban culture doesn't need big budgets or cutting-edge technology to create beauty. It only needs two neighborhoods, a year of secret preparation, and one night under the stars of Remedios.* 🎆
