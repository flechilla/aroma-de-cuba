The escalation of tensions between Cuba and the United States, combined with Washington's oil blockade, has led governments across the Americas and Europe to issue warnings to citizens planning to travel to the island.

## Argentina: "Avoid or Postpone Tourist Trips"

Argentina's government was the most direct, recommending that citizens **"avoid or postpone tourist trips"** to Cuba due to fuel, food, and water shortages, as well as prolonged power outages.

## Canada Warns of "Unpredictable" Situation

Canada, historically the main source of tourists to the island, warned that the current situation is **"unpredictable and could deteriorate, affecting flight availability on short notice."**

On its official page, the Canadian government indicated that "a high degree of caution should be exercised in Cuba due to worsening shortages of electricity, fuel, and basic necessities, including food, water, and medicine, which may also affect tourist resorts."

## UK and Spain Also Issue Alerts

The **UK Foreign Office** warned of blackouts that can exceed 24 consecutive hours and affect basic services. It also noted that fuel shortages may cancel or delay tourist plans without notice.

The **Spanish embassy** elaborated on "the weakness of Cuba's power generation and distribution system" and mentioned the chikungunya epidemic that affected the island in 2025. It recommends travelers carry a first-aid kit with essential medications.

## US Embassy Warns About Power Grid

The US embassy in Havana warned that Cuba's electrical grid "is increasingly unstable" and that blackout effects cut across all sectors.

## Tourism in Free Fall

These warnings threaten one of the key sectors of the Cuban economy. While Cuba attracted **4.7 million tourists** in 2018 (its historic record), the island ended 2025 with just **1.8 million international visitors**.

Tourism was already suffering from US sanctions, the pandemic, and the national economic crisis affecting service quality.

## The Oil Blockade

The United States cut off Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3. Last week, Trump threatened tariffs on countries providing fuel to the island.

In response, the Cuban government has launched an emergency plan inspired by the "zero option," a survival strategy conceived during the Special Period of the 1990s.
