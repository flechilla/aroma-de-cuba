On the Cuban table, there's a dessert that transcends generations: **guava paste** (dulce de guayaba). That deep ruby-colored paste, firm to the touch yet melting in your mouth with an unmistakable tropical flavor, is much more than a simple sweet — it's a piece of Cuba you can take anywhere in the world.

## Guava: The Queen Fruit of the Caribbean

The [guava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guava) (*Psidium guajava*) is a fruit native to tropical America that found ideal conditions to thrive in Cuba. The Taíno people consumed it before the Spanish arrival, and over time it became one of the island's most beloved fruits.

What makes Cuban guava special is its **penetrating aroma** — capable of perfuming an entire room — and its flavor that perfectly balances sweetness with a hint of acidity. These characteristics intensify when transformed into paste, creating a product with its own unique personality.

## From Fresh Fruit to Traditional Sweet

The production of guava paste is a process that has remained practically unchanged for centuries:

### Essential Ingredients
- **Ripe guava pulp** — the heart of the sweet
- **Sugar** — in almost equal proportion to the fruit
- **Citric acid** — to preserve color and balance sweetness

### The Artisanal Process

1. **Selection**: Ripe but firm guavas with intense aroma are chosen
2. **Initial cooking**: The fruit is boiled until soft
3. **Straining**: Skin and seeds are removed, keeping only the smooth pulp
4. **Concentration**: The pulp is cooked with sugar over low heat, stirring constantly
5. **Perfect point**: When the mixture pulls away from the pot bottom, it's ready
6. **Molding**: Poured into molds and left to cool until solid

The result is a brilliant **ruby-red paste** with a firm yet flexible texture, capable of being cut into bars, squares, or any desired shape.

## Guava with Cheese: The Perfect Pairing

There's no combination more Cuban than **guava paste with cream cheese**. This pairing, known as *"casamiento"* (marriage) on the island, unites two opposite flavors that complement each other magically:

- **Intense sweetness** from the guava
- **Salty creaminess** from the cheese

### Types of Cheese That Pair Well

| Cheese | Characteristics | Experience |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cream cheese** | Soft, spreadable | The Miami classic |
| **Fresh white cheese** | Firm, salty | Cuban tradition |
| **Goat cheese** | Tangy, intense | Gourmet version |
| **Young Manchego** | Medium flavor | Hispanic fusion |

Temperature contrast also adds to the experience: room-temperature guava paste over cold cheese is a sensory delight.

## The Guava Pastry: Icon of the Exile

In Miami and wherever Cubans reside, the **guava pastry** (pastelito de guayaba) became a symbol of identity. This puff pastry filled with guava paste — sometimes with cream cheese — is the inseparable companion of [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuban-coffee-cafecito-history-recipe/).

**Cuban cafeterias** on Calle Ocho sell thousands of pastelitos daily, keeping alive a tradition that connects the diaspora to their roots.

It's one of those products that transcends the gastronomic to become **emotional heritage**. Every bite tastes like Cuba, no matter how far from the island you may be.
