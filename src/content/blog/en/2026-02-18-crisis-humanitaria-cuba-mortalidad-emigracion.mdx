faq:
  - question: "How many Cubans have emigrated since 2021?"
    answer: "An estimated 2 million Cubans have left the country since 2021, one of the most dramatic emigration waves in recent Latin American history."
  - question: "How has infant mortality changed in Cuba?"
    answer: "Cuba's infant mortality rate rose from 5 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021 to 14 per 1,000 by late 2025 — nearly tripling the previous level."
  - question: "Is Cuba's crisis solely the result of Trump's sanctions?"
    answer: "Not entirely. While Trump's energy blockade worsened conditions, the crisis has deeper roots: decades of an inefficient state economic model and the collapse of Venezuelan support since 2016."
  - question: "What diseases have returned to Cuba due to the crisis?"
    answer: "Dengue, chikungunya, and Oropuche virus are surging because Havana's municipal waste collection system collapsed in 2025, creating mosquito breeding grounds across the city."

Cuba is facing what experts describe as **one of the worst social and economic catastrophes since the 1959 Revolution**. And while President Trump's sanctions have accelerated the collapse, the crisis has much deeper roots.

## Two Million Cubans Have Voted With Their Feet

Since 2021, an estimated **2 million Cubans have left the island** — an unprecedented population drain. The exodus has left hospitals understaffed, schools without teachers, and families torn apart on both sides of the Florida Strait.

## Infant Mortality Spikes

Cuba historically boasted **5 deaths per 1,000 live births** in 2021. By late 2025, that figure had climbed to **14 per 1,000** — nearly triple. Behind that number are babies dying from lack of medicines and hospitals without reliable electricity.

## Forgotten Diseases Return

Dengue, chikungunya, and Oropuche virus are surging. The reason: Havana's municipal waste collection system collapsed in 2025, creating perfect mosquito breeding grounds. Inflation exceeds 15% and the Cuban peso continues to lose value.

## Beyond Trump

It would be convenient to blame everything on Washington, but honest analysis reveals a more complex reality. The crisis is rooted in decades of a state economic model unable to adapt, the collapse of Venezuelan support since 2016, and the impact of COVID-19.

Trump's sanctions are the trigger. But the gunpowder has been accumulating for years.
