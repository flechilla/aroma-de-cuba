The foreign ministers of Cuba and Spain will hold a meeting this Monday, February 16, in Madrid, focused on the current situation on the island. Spanish Foreign Minister **José Manuel Albares** will receive his Cuban counterpart, **Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla**, according to sources from Spain's foreign ministry confirmed to [EFE news agency](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/albares-recibir%C3%A1-en-madrid-al-canciller-de-cuba-para-analizar-la-situaci%C3%B3n-en-la-isla/90946799).

## A Diplomatic Tour Amid the Storm

Rodríguez arrives in Madrid closing an intense international tour that took him to **China and Vietnam**, two of Cuba's historical allies, seeking support against mounting pressure from Washington.

In **Vietnam**, the foreign minister met with Communist Party leader To Lam and President Luong Cuong. In **China**, he held talks with several officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He also spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister **Sergei Lavrov** during the trip.

The tour comes at a critical moment for the island: the [oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration](/en/blog/2026-02-14-incendio-refineria-nico-lopez-habana/) has worsened an energy crisis that has already caused [record blackouts affecting 64%](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) of the country.

## Spain and Cuba: Ties Under Pressure

The meeting will also address the upcoming **Ibero-American Summit**, scheduled for November 4-5 in Madrid. Spain maintains significant economic ties with Cuba, particularly through hotel chains like Meliá and NH, which face [growing operational difficulties](/en/blog/2026-02-10-melia-reduce-hoteles-cuba-crisis-turismo/) on the island.

The meeting request came from Rodríguez himself, taking advantage of his layover in Madrid on his way back to Havana. The gesture reflects Cuba's diplomatic urgency to expand its international support network as many already draw comparisons to a [new Special Period](https://elpais.com/america/2026-02-15/cuba-teme-que-la-crisis-actual-la-devuelva-al-periodo-especial-de-los-anos-noventa.html).

## Context: The Island Seeks Allies

Beijing, Hanoi, and Moscow have all publicly reiterated their support for Cuba and promised help "within their capabilities." However, none has taken the step of sending oil directly, wary of [secondary sanctions](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/cancilleres-de-cuba-y-espana-se-reuniran-en-madrid-para-analizar-la-situacion-de-la-isla/) announced by Washington.

China, for example, [sent 90,000 tons of rice](/en/blog/2026-02-12-china-arroz-petroleo-cuba/) but avoided committing to oil shipments. Mexico dispatched [humanitarian aid by naval vessels](/en/blog/2026-02-13-buques-mexico-ayuda-humanitaria-cuba/), also without crude.

In this context, the Madrid meeting represents another chapter in Cuba's intense diplomatic offensive to prevent the total collapse of its energy system.
