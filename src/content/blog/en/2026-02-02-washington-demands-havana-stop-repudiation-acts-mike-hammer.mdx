The United States government formally protested to Cuba following repudiation acts against the Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires in Havana, **Mike Hammer**, which have fueled controversy amid the bilateral crisis.

## Washington: "Cease the Repressive Acts"

The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department was forceful in its message, posted on X:

> "The illegitimate Cuban regime must immediately cease its repressive acts of sending individuals to interfere with the diplomatic work of Chargé d'Affaires Hammer and Embassy staff members."

The State Department division assured that its diplomats "will continue meeting with the Cuban people, despite the regime's failed intimidation tactics."

## Repudiation Acts in Camagüey and Trinidad

The incidents took place in the cities of **Camagüey and Trinidad**. Viral videos show groups of people shouting offenses at Hammer outside a hostel where he was staying.

According to unofficial media and social media posts, these acts were allegedly organized by the **Communist Party** and **Young Communist League (UJC)**, which initially shared them as proof of Cuban opposition to Trump Administration measures.

## Hammer Responds with Irony

The American diplomat responded ironically on Embassy social media:

> "Some people, surely frustrated communists, shouted obscenities and insults at me. I think they belong to a certain Party."

Hammer assured that those people "do not represent the Cuban people, ordinary Cubans," and confirmed he will continue traveling the country and visiting homes of those who write to him showing willingness to receive him.

## Social Media Controversy

The incident has fueled polarization on social media. Cuban-American Congresswoman **María Elvira Salazar** called these acts "state-directed political attacks carried out by the regime's repressive machinery."

So far, the Cuban government has not officially commented on the incidents, though pro-government profiles have defended the demonstrations against Hammer, calling him a "representative of arrogant imperialism."
