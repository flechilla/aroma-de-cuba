  - question: "What is changing about Cuba's ration system in April?"
    answer: "The government will stop subsidizing products in the ration basket and instead provide direct subsidies to the most vulnerable people. Products will be sold at liberalized but differentiated prices based on each family's economic situation."
  - question: "Is Cuba eliminating the libreta de abastecimiento?"
    answer: "The ration book hasn't been formally abolished, but the new system radically transforms how it works. Instead of uniform subsidized prices, only the most vulnerable will receive direct state assistance."
  - question: "How long has Cuba's ration book system existed?"
    answer: "It was established in 1962 as a response to food shortages. It has functioned for over 60 years as a permanent distribution mechanism, though it has progressively deteriorated in recent decades."
  - question: "Why is Cuba changing its ration system now?"
    answer: "The reform is part of an economic program to 'correct distortions' and has been accelerated by the energy crisis caused by the U.S. oil blockade, which has worsened shortages of basic goods on the island."

Cuba is preparing for one of the most significant economic changes in decades. Starting **April 2026**, the government will eliminate direct subsidies on products in the **rationed family basket** (*canasta familiar normada*) and replace them with targeted assistance for the most vulnerable, according to Havana officials.

## The End of a 60-Year Model

The [*libreta de abastecimiento*](https://oncubanews.com/tag/libreta-abastecimiento/) (ration book) was created in **1962** as a "temporary" measure to guarantee access to basic foods — rice, sugar, cooking oil, meats, beans — at subsidized prices in state-run bodegas. More than six decades later, that system faces its most profound transformation.

According to a session of the Municipal Administration Council of El Cotorro in Havana, rationed products **will be sold at liberalized prices** with differentiated rates between consumers. State aid will be concentrated on those most in need, while local production is incentivized.

> "Products will be controlled, liberalized for sale, but at prices different from the current rationed basket, where people will be subsidized instead of products"
> — [Tribuna de La Habana](https://www.tribuna.cu/capitalinas/2026-02-17/eliminar-trabas-y-tierras-ociosas)

## What Remains Unknown

The announcement leaves many questions unanswered:

- **Which specific products** from the ration basket will enter the new system?
- **How will authorities determine** who qualifies for direct subsidies?
- **What will the price difference** be between subsidized and non-subsidized consumers?
- **What happens to Cubans** who fall outside the aid system?

Havana Governor **Yanet Hernández Pérez** noted that implementation "demands intensive work through what remains of February and March" and that local production capacity will be fundamental.

## "We'll Eat What Is Produced Locally"

President **Miguel Díaz-Canel** had already signaled this direction in a [recent televised address](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=870468229231997), stating his government would change "the concept" of the ration basket to eliminate three historic problems: **dependence on imports**, **centralized distribution**, and **egalitarianism**.

This philosophy of "eating what's produced locally" echoes the survival strategies of the [Special Period of the 1990s](/en/blog/2026-02-17-periodo-especial-cuba-crisis-1990s), when the Soviet Union's collapse forced Cuba to reinvent its food system through urban gardens and subsistence farming.

## A Reform Amid the Worst Crisis in Decades

The new system arrives as Cuba faces the [most severe energy crisis since 1959](/en/blog/2026-02-17-sherritt-pausa-operaciones-cuba-crisis-petroleo), worsened by the oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration. Blackouts exceed 12 hours daily in several provinces, and the island still hasn't completed delivery of the **January and February** ration baskets.

International pressure is also intensifying. The [White House declared Wednesday](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2026/02/19/la-casa-blanca-exige-cambios-drasticos-en-cuba-el-regimen-esta-cayendo/) that "the regime is falling" and demanded "drastic changes," while [Mexico is exploring mediation](/en/blog/2026-02-19-mexico-mediacion-eeuu-cuba-sheinbaum) between Washington and Havana.

Meanwhile, [Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez traveled to Moscow](/en/blog/2026-02-18-canciller-cuba-putin-moscu-crisis) to meet Vladimir Putin seeking energy assistance, and an [oil tanker managed to dock in Matanzas](/en/blog/2026-02-17-petrolero-nicos-llega-matanzas-crisis-energetica) this week — the first since January 9.

## What This Means for Cubans

For millions of Cuban families, the ration book has been the difference between eating and going hungry for decades. Although the system has been deteriorating for years — with products arriving late, incomplete, or not at all — it remains a lifeline for the most vulnerable.

The shift to **targeted subsidies** is technically more efficient, but poses enormous risks in a country where:

- **Inflation** has eroded wages to unsustainable levels
- No **reliable income registry** exists to determine who needs help
- **Local agricultural production** is insufficient to meet demand
- The **energy crisis** has paralyzed transportation and food distribution

Cuba is entering uncharted territory. The ration system reform isn't just an economic adjustment — it's the transformation of a social contract that has defined daily life on the island for over 60 years.
