## The movement that turned a guitar into a poetic weapon

In late-1960s Cuba, while the world seethed with social movements and counterculture, a group of young Cuban musicians created something no revolution had achieved before: **they turned the popular song into the most intimate and universal voice of a generation**.

[Nueva Trova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_trova) wasn't just a music genre. It was an act of faith in the power of a guitar, a voice, and words that refused to be banal.

## Origins: from trova to commitment

Cuba had a troubadour tradition dating back to the 19th century in Santiago de Cuba. Trovadores like [Sindo Garay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindo_Garay) and Manuel Corona had established a canon of poetic guitar-based song that defined Cuban musical identity.

But by the 1960s, that tradition needed renewal. Young people who had grown up with the 1959 Revolution wanted to express their reality — not just romantic love, but social justice, anti-colonialism, Latin American identity.

The spark came on **February 18, 1968**, when three young musicians — **Silvio Rodríguez**, **Pablo Milanés**, and **Noel Nicola** — gave a concert now considered the official birth of the movement. There was no name yet, but the energy was unmistakable.

## Silvio Rodríguez: poet of the impossible

Born in [San Antonio de los Baños](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_de_los_Ba%C3%B1os) in 1946, Silvio Rodríguez transformed Cuban song with unprecedented poetic language. Songs like *Ojalá*, *Unicornio*, *La era está pariendo un corazón*, and *Playa Girón* proved you could be profoundly lyrical and socially committed at the same time.

His influence transcends Cuba: entire generations across Latin America, Spain, and beyond grew up humming his melodies. His albums *Días y flores* (1975) and *Mujeres* (1978) are pillars of 20th-century Spanish-language music.

> *"The era is giving birth to a heart / it can't go on, it's dying of pain / and we must come running, for the future is falling..."*

## Pablo Milanés: the voice of feeling

If Silvio was the hermetic poet, **Pablo Milanés** (Bayamo, 1943 – Madrid, 2022) was the movement's open heart. Trained in [filin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil%C3%ADn) — Cuba's romantic song movement of the 1950s — Pablo brought a melodic warmth that made even the most complex themes accessible.

*Yolanda*, perhaps Cuba's most famous love song, is his. But so are deeply committed pieces like *Yo pisaré las calles nuevamente* (written for Chile after Pinochet's coup) and *Cuba va*.

Pablo passed away in November 2022 in Madrid, leaving an irreplaceable void in Latin American music. His legacy lives on in every trovador who picks up a guitar with something to say.

## The ICAIC Sound Experimentation Group

In 1969, under the auspices of the [Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAIC), the **Grupo de Experimentación Sonora** (GESI) was formed. Led by Leo Brouwer, the renowned Cuban classical guitarist, the group brought together Silvio, Pablo, Noel Nicola, [Sara González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Gonz%C3%A1lez), Eduardo Ramos, and other young musicians.

GESI was a laboratory: they composed soundtracks for ICAIC documentaries while exploring fusions of [trova](/en/blog/punto-cubano-decima-patrimonio-unesco/), jazz, rock, and Afro-Cuban music. This experimentation gave the movement a musical sophistication that set it apart from other Latin American protest song movements.

## Continental connections

Nueva Trova didn't exist in a vacuum. It drew from and fed into Chile's [Nueva Canción](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_canci%C3%B3n) of Violeta Parra and Víctor Jara, Argentina's new song movement of Mercedes Sosa, Catalonia's nova cançó of Joan Manuel Serrat, and Brazilian tropicalismo of Caetano Veloso.

They all shared an ideal: song as a tool for social transformation, the guitar as companion to peoples in struggle. But Cuban Nueva Trova had a unique ingredient — Caribbean rhythm, the heritage of [son cubano](/en/blog/2026-02-10-son-cubano-rhythm-that-conquered-world/), and the island's poetic tradition.

## Beyond the founders

The movement transcended its three pillars. Figures like **Sara González** (trova's most powerful female voice), **Amaury Pérez**, **Vicente Feliú**, and **Carlos Varela** (considered the bridge between Nueva Trova and later generations) expanded the Cuban trovador universe.

Carlos Varela, in particular, introduced a more introspective and critical gaze from the 1980s onward, with songs like *Guillermo Tell* that resonated deeply with Cuban youth during the [Special Period](/en/blog/2026-02-12-timba-cubana-musica-explosiva-habana/).

## Trova today: alive and transforming

Nueva Trova as a formal movement no longer exists, but its spirit beats on every corner of Cuba. Trova gatherings in cultural centers, young people with guitars on the Malecón, and a new generation of Cuban singer-songwriters who recognize Silvio and Pablo as inescapable roots.

The movement's deepest legacy wasn't political but human: it proved that a well-written song, sung with truth, can cross oceans and decades without losing its power.
