faq:
  - question: "Where was the daiquiri invented?"
    answer: "The daiquiri was born in 1898 near the Daiquirí iron mines in Santiago de Cuba. Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer, created it by mixing rum, lime, and sugar to refresh his colleagues during the tropical heat."
  - question: "What's the difference between a daiquiri and a frozen daiquiri?"
    answer: "The original daiquiri is shaken with ice and served strained in a chilled coupe. The frozen version, popularized in the United States, is blended with ice to a slushy consistency. Cuban purists prefer the classic version."
  - question: "What rum is used for an authentic Cuban daiquiri?"
    answer: "An authentic daiquiri uses 3-year white Cuban rum, preferably Havana Club 3 Años. The rum should be light and dry so it doesn't overpower the fresh lime's acidity."
  - question: "How much does a daiquiri cost at El Floridita in Havana?"
    answer: "In 2026, a daiquiri at El Floridita costs around $7-10 USD. While more expensive than other bars, the historic experience and cocktail quality justify the price."

In the world of mixology, few drinks have a story as fascinating as the **Cuban daiquiri**. This crystalline cocktail, seemingly simple in composition, hides over a century of tradition, refinement, and legend.

## Birth at the Daiquirí Mines

The daiquiri wasn't born in an elegant Havana bar but in the dusty iron mines near **Santiago de Cuba** in 1898. [Jennings Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennings_Cox), an American mining engineer, faced a common tropical problem: the suffocating heat.

Legend has it that when he ran out of gin during a meeting with colleagues, Cox improvised with what he had on hand:

- Local **white rum** from Bacardí
- **Fresh limes** from the garden
- **Sugar** from nearby mills
- Plenty of **crushed ice**

The result was so refreshing that Cox named it after the nearby beach: **Daiquirí**. The recipe spread quickly among American soldiers during the Spanish-American War and traveled back to the United States with them.

## El Floridita: The Cathedral of the Daiquiri

While Cox invented the daiquiri, it was **Constantino Ribalaigua Vert** who elevated it to perfection. This Galician bartender, affectionately known as "El Grande" or "Constante," worked at [El Floridita](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147271-d299541-Reviews-El_Floridita-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html) in Havana from 1914 until his death in 1952.

Constante transformed the original daiquiri into a work of art. His innovations included:

- **Shaking the cocktail** with a frappe machine for perfect texture
- **Meticulous straining** to remove every trace of ice
- **Balancing the proportions** to achieve ideal harmony
- **Serving in a frozen glass** to maintain temperature

El Floridita, located at the corner of Obispo and Monserrate, earned the title "**The Cradle of the Daiquiri**" and has appeared on lists of the world's best bars since 1953.

## Hemingway and the Special Daiquiri

No daiquiri story would be complete without mentioning **Ernest Hemingway**. The Nobel laureate discovered El Floridita in 1932 and was captivated. His famous phrase sums up his love for Cuban cocktails:

> "My mojito in La Bodeguita, my daiquiri in El Floridita"

But Hemingway didn't drink just any daiquiri. Due to his diabetes, he asked Constante for a special version: **double rum, no sugar, with drops of maraschino**. This variation is known today as "**Papa Doble**" or "**Hemingway Special**."

The writer was such a regular that he had his own barstool (the same one now occupied by a bronze statue in his honor). It's said that on his best days he could down 12 to 15 daiquirís in a single session.

## The Original Cuban Daiquiri Recipe

After more than a century of variations, this is the classic recipe still served in Havana:

### Ingredients

- 60 ml (2 oz) [white Cuban rum](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa/) (Havana Club 3 Años)
- 30 ml (1 oz) fresh lime juice (never lemon)
- 15 ml (½ oz) simple syrup (or 2 teaspoons sugar)
- Plenty of ice

### Preparation

1. **Chill the glass** by placing it in the freezer or filling with ice
2. **Squeeze fresh limes** — bottled juice won't work
3. **Add all ingredients** to a shaker with ice
4. **Shake vigorously** for 15-20 seconds
5. **Double strain** into the chilled glass
6. **Garnish with a lime wheel** (optional)

The result should be a **crystal-clear, cold, and balanced** cocktail — neither too sweet nor too sour.

## Cuban Daiquiri Variations

Several versions of the classic daiquiri developed in Cuba:

| Variation | Extra Ingredient | Origin |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Daiquirí Natural** | None (original) | Daiquirí Mines |
| **Daiquirí Floridita** | Maraschino | El Floridita |
| **Papa Doble** | Double rum, no sugar, maraschino | Hemingway |
| **Mulata** | Crème de cacao | Havana |
| **Strawberry Daiquiri** | Fresh strawberries | Modern |

## The Rum: The Soul of the Daiquiri

Not just any rum works for a good daiquiri. The cocktail requires a **light, dry white rum** that allows the lime and overall balance to shine. Cuban rums like [Havana Club 3 Años](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa/) are ideal because they:

- Have subtle notes of cane and vanilla
- Don't dominate other flavors
- Provide smoothness without heaviness
- Integrate perfectly with citrus

Using an aged or highly aromatic rum produces an unbalanced cocktail — save the 7-year rum for sipping neat.

## Where to Drink the Best Daiquiri

### In Cuba

- **El Floridita** (Havana) — The original, a historic experience
- **La Bodeguita del Medio** (Havana) — Better known for mojitos but makes good daiquirís
- **Hotel Nacional** (Havana) — Elegant bar with Malecón views

### In Miami

- **Ball & Chain** (Little Havana) — Authentic Cuban atmosphere
- **Café La Trova** (Miami Beach) — From chef Michelle Bernstein
- **Versailles** (Little Havana) — Cuban exile institution

### In Europe

- **Dry Martini** (Barcelona) — Top-tier classic cocktail bar
- **Museo Chicote** (Madrid) — Another bar with literary history

## The Daiquiri in Cuban Culture

The daiquiri transcends gastronomy to become a cultural symbol. It represents:

- **Cuban inventiveness** in the face of scarcity
- The **refinement of pre-revolutionary Havana**
- The connection to **world literature** via Hemingway
- Pride in **Cuban rum**

Today, while tourists fill El Floridita to photograph themselves next to Hemingway's statue, Habaneros often prefer homemade versions or less crowded bars. But the ritual remains: fresh lime, white rum, just enough sugar, and plenty of ice.

## Conclusion

The Cuban daiquiri is more than a cocktail — it's a liquid time capsule connecting the Santiago de Cuba mines of 1898 with bars worldwide in 2026. Every well-prepared sip honors Jennings Cox's tradition, Constante's perfectionism, and Hemingway's enthusiasm.

Next time you raise a glass of daiquiri, remember: you're drinking Cuban history.
