In a historic moment for Cuban animation, **ICAIC's Animation Studios** have premiered **TITOVERSE: Genesis**, the first superhero series produced on the island in its 66-year history of animated filmmaking.

## The Birth of a Cuban Heroic Universe

The short film was presented as part of celebrations for the anniversary of the legendary studios that brought to life icons like [Elpidio Valdés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elpidio_Vald%C3%A9s), created by master animator Juan Padrón. According to **Daniel Martín Subiaut**, creator, director, and co-writer of the project, TITOVERSE was born from an urgent cultural need:

> "To fill the void of homegrown superheroes for the Cuban and Latin American Alpha generation that looks more to the north than to our own countries."

## Tito Reacciona: A Hero for Generation Alpha

The protagonist of this epic adventure is **Tito Reacciona**, a young Cuban who, on his fifteenth birthday, unknowingly activates a time loop called "TITOVERSE." His mission to break the cycle will lead him to face the creator of all childhood scary stories, accompanied by three warriors of Cuban blood.

What distinguishes this series is its **"glocal" approach**: each episode will take place in a different era and country, exploring legends and historical figures from **twenty different cultures**, while maintaining the unmistakable stamp of Cuban humor.

## Juan Padrón's Legacy Lives On

Subiaut acknowledges the direct influence of Cuban animation tradition on his work, especially that of [Juan Padrón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Padr%C3%B3n), creator of Vampiros en La Habana and Elpidio Valdés:

> "We've noticed it's funny for both adults and children. Humor is what connects us to that tradition."

**Alexis Triana**, president of [ICAIC](https://www.icaic.cu/), highlighted during the presentation the series' potential to "develop the Cuban animation industry" and compete in international markets with an authentically Cuban product.

## Unlimited Creativity with Limited Resources

TITOVERSE's premiere is also a triumph over adversity. Subiaut described the technical obstacles the team faced: a significant reduction in animators after the pandemic and technological limitations exacerbated by the financial blockade.

> "Working with few artists and old computers has been the biggest challenge."

Despite these challenges, the series features an **all-star voice cast** including several figures from Cuban film and television, adding quality and anticipation to the project.

## A Step Into the Latin American Multiverse

TITOVERSE represents more than entertainment: it's a declaration of cultural identity. In a world dominated by American superheroes, Cuba plants its flag in the genre with characters that reflect the island's values, humor, and identity.

The project also responds to Asian market demands, which suggested adjustments like raising the protagonist's age, demonstrating the creative team's international commercial vision.
