All seemed lost. The Curaçao squad had punished starter Darío Sarduy and the relief pitchers, manufacturing 10 runs through the first four innings. The celebration in the opposing dugout seemed premature.

But Cuba had other plans.

In the bottom of the sixth inning, manager **Germán Mesa's** squad unleashed a devastating offensive explosion: **11 runs** in a single frame that completely flipped the scoreboard. The key moment came when **Yoelquis Guibert** lined a clutch single that brought two teammates home to tie the game.

> "I'm super happy. It's always important to contribute to the team, and it was my turn. They gave me that responsibility, and thank God the job got done."
> — Yoelquis Guibert

## Despaigne: The Timely Hero

With the game tied, **Alfredo Despaigne** stepped in as a pinch hitter and crushed a double that drove in two runs, giving Cuba the definitive lead. A moment that reminded everyone why Despaigne remains a Cuban baseball legend.

## The Numbers Behind the Win

- **Luis Vicente Mateo**: 4 hits
- **Roel Santos**: 2 hits, 2 RBIs
- **Yasiel González**: double, 2 RBIs (tournament leader with 9)
- **Michel Cabrera**: winning pitcher in relief (2.1 IP, 1 run)
- **Frank Abel Álvarez**: save (final 3 outs)

## What's Next

Cuba continues its journey through the Caribbean Series with a record that keeps them in contention for the semifinals. The resilience shown in this game demonstrates that when the Cuban team finds its offensive rhythm, it can compete against any rival in the Caribbean.

At a time when Cuba faces challenges on multiple fronts, this sporting victory offers a moment of joy and pride for fans on and off the island.
