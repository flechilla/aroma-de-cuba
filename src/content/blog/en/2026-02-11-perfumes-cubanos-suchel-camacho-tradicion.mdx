When discussing Cuban products, rum, coffee, and cigars usually steal the spotlight. But there's a lesser-known aromatic treasure that has captivated noses for generations: the **Cuban perfumes of Suchel Camacho**, the island's most emblematic fragrance house.

## The History of Cuban Perfumery

Cuba's perfume tradition runs deep. Since the late 19th century, houses like **Crusellas**, **Gravi**, and **Sabatés** established Havana as a Caribbean center for fragrance creation. The tropical climate, with its abundance of flowers and aromatic plants, provided exceptional raw materials.

The [Old Havana Perfume Museum](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-havana-perfume-museum), known as "Habana 1791," preserves this history and continues crafting artisanal fragrances using traditional methods.

## Suchel Camacho: Cuba's Perfumery Giant

**Suchel Camacho S.A.** is today the leading company in perfumery, cosmetics, and personal care in Cuba. Their catalog includes over 80 fragrances ranging from fresh colognes to sophisticated eau de parfums.

### Iconic Fragrances

**Coral Negro** - Arguably the most internationally recognized Cuban perfume. This feminine fragrance combines:
- Top notes: Citrus and galbanum
- Heart: Rose and tropical jasmine
- Base: Sandalwood, amber, musk, and patchouli

**Mariposa** - Inspired by *Hedychium coronarium*, Cuba's national flower. A white floral fragrance evoking Havana's gardens.

**Vegueros** - For men, paying tribute to Cuba's tobacco tradition with woody and spicy notes.

**Alicia** - Created in collaboration with the Cuban National Ballet, an elegant and sophisticated fragrance.

**Camerata** - Another perfume inspired by the world of Cuban classical dance.
