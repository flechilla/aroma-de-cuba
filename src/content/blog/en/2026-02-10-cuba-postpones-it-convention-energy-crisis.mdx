The Organizing Committee of the XX International Convention and Fair Informática 2026 announced Monday the postponement of the event, originally scheduled to take place from March 24 to 27.

## "Extraordinary Situation"

According to the official statement published by [Cubadebate](http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2026/02/09/posponen-xx-convencion-y-feria-internacional-informatica-2026/), the decision responds to "the extraordinary situation the country is experiencing, caused by the genocidal blockade exercised by the United States Government against Cuba and its new escalation of aggressions to economically suffocate our people."

The Committee assured it will announce the new date "in due time."

## Cuba's Main Technology Event

The International Convention and Fair Informática is considered Cuba's main technology event. It annually brings together:

- National and international specialists
- Technology sector companies
- Academics and researchers
- Government ICT entities

The event serves as a platform to present advances, establish collaborations and business deals within the IT sector, as well as strengthen ties with companies and experts from other nations, particularly from Latin America and Europe.

## Another Symptom of the Crisis

The event cancellation joins the list of consequences from the energy and economic crisis Cuba is experiencing:

- [International flight suspensions](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights)
- [Mexico halts oil shipments](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade)

The lack of fuel and constant blackouts make it practically impossible to organize events of this magnitude, which require stable electrical infrastructure and transportation logistics.
