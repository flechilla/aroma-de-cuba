## Pressure beyond oil

The United States' offensive against Cuba is no longer limited to the [energy blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-18-eeuu-envios-combustible-cuba-licencias-privadas) or [diplomatic sanctions](/en/blog/2026-02-16-rubio-apertura-economica-cuba-munich). It now targets one of the Cuban government's most emblematic economic pillars: international medical missions.

In recent weeks, several Caribbean and Central American countries have reduced or canceled their healthcare cooperation agreements with Havana, according to [EFE news agency](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/america-latina/cuba-es/article314717340.html). The moves respond to growing diplomatic pressure from Washington, which seeks to strangle the Cuban government's revenue sources.

## Who has pulled out

The most notable cases so far:

- **Bahamas** suspended the hiring of Cuban doctors
- **Guyana** definitively ended the program this February
- **Guatemala** announced the gradual closure of its agreement throughout 2026
- **Jamaica** is [renegotiating the terms](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-17-u1-e208933-s27061-nid321094-ministro-jamaica-dice-renegocian-programa-medico) of its program

## Rubio: "Forced labor schemes"

Secretary of State Marco Rubio left no room for ambiguity. He described the medical missions as **"forced labor schemes"** with **"abusive and coercive labor practices"** and announced the revocation of visas for Cuban and foreign officials involved in hiring Cuban healthcare personnel.

The measure follows the pressure line Rubio has maintained since his [economic opening proposal in Munich](/en/blog/2026-02-16-rubio-apertura-economica-cuba-munich) and the [negotiations Trump confirmed](/en/blog/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo).

## A multi-billion dollar business

The numbers explain why this front matters so much. The State Department estimates that professional service exports generate between **$6 billion and $8 billion annually** for Cuba — a figure that exceeds tourism revenue even in its best years.

Over more than six decades, Cuba has sent approximately 600,000 healthcare professionals to 165 countries. For host governments, the program offers quick access to qualified medical personnel. For Havana, it's a vital source of hard currency.

However, organizations like [Prisoners Defenders](https://www.prisonersdefenders.org/) report that the Cuban government retains up to **85% of the payments** made by host countries, while also restricting doctors' freedom of movement abroad. Accusations that the Cuban government denies.

## The impact on an already battered economy

This offensive compounds an already devastating picture for the Cuban economy:

- The [energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba) keeping the country in massive blackouts
- The [tourism collapse](/en/blog/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis) due to aviation fuel shortages
- The [5% GDP contraction](/en/blog/2026-02-10-economia-cuba-se-contrajo-cinco-porciento-2025) in 2025

The big unknown is Venezuela, where thousands of Cuban professionals continue providing services under bilateral agreements. If US pressure reaches those contracts too, the financial blow to Cuba would be unprecedented.

## Cooperation or exploitation?

The debate over Cuban medical missions isn't new, but Washington's pressure has intensified it. For Cuba, it's solidarity-based cooperation and a showcase of its public health capabilities. For critics, it's a system that exploits highly qualified professionals while the government keeps most of the money.

What's undeniable is that, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in decades, losing this revenue source could push Cuba even closer to the edge.
