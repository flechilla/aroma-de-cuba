The Latin music world is in mourning. **Willie Colón**, the Bronx-born trombonist who forever transformed salsa and whose work is inextricably bound to the Cuban musical tradition, died on **Saturday, February 21, 2026**, at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, New York. He was **75 years old**.

"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father and renowned musician, Willie Colón. He departed peacefully this morning, surrounded by his loving family," his family said in a statement. "While we mourn his absence, we also rejoice in the eternal gift of his music and the cherished memories he created, which will live on forever."

Colón had been hospitalized at Lawrence Hospital days earlier with **cardiac and respiratory complications**.

## The Bronx Kid Who Embraced Cuban Son

William Anthony Colón Román was born on **April 28, 1950**, in the South Bronx, in the heart of New York City's Puerto Rican community. But his music always had deep roots in the Cuban tradition: son, mambo, cha-cha-chá, and rumba were the foundations on which he built a sonic empire.

At **16 years old**, he recorded his first album, *El malo* (1967), alongside the legendary singer **Héctor Lavoe**, launching one of salsa's most iconic duos on Fania Records. The Bronx gangster attitude fused with Caribbean rhythms created something entirely new — and the world embraced it.

Growing up on Bronx street corners while legends like Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, and Ray Barreto were defining the genre — a blend of jazz, mambo, son, jíbaro music, and cha-cha-chá — Colón matched them step for step, and in sales, surpassed them all.

## Four Albums With Celia Cruz: Willie's Cuban Soul

Colón's connection to Cuba was not merely musical — it was deeply human. He recorded no fewer than **four albums alongside Celia Cruz**, the undisputed queen of salsa and Cuban son. Those collaborations produced timeless gems that still ring out at Latin celebrations around the world.

Beyond that, his rendition of *Idilio* — composed by Puerto Rican Alberto "Titi" Amadeo — was popularized in Cuba in the 1990s by **Laito Sureda**, a former vocalist of the legendary Sonora Matancera, creating one of those invisible bonds that forever tie Willie Colón to the island.

His influence on Cuba was such that even amid today's deepest crisis — with [the Cuban diaspora facing painful decisions about their properties and futures on the island](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ley-vivienda-cuba-emigrados/) — Colón's songs still fill the patios and phones of millions of Cubans.

## *Siembra*: The Best-Selling Album in Fania Records History

In 1977, Colón began his partnership with **Rubén Blades**, the Panamanian singer-songwriter. Together they recorded *Metiendo mano* (1977) and the monumental *Siembra* (1978), widely considered the best-selling album in Fania Records history, with more than **3 million copies** sold worldwide.

*Pedro Navaja*, the centerpiece of *Siembra*, is a seven-minute existentialist narrative about the life and death of a Latino street gangster in New York. **Rolling Stone** ranked *Siembra* #1 on its list of the 50 greatest salsa albums of all time.

"The duo's greatest virtue was remaining true to the exuberant spirit of salsa and proving that its emotional core had no limits," the magazine wrote.

Blades reacted to the news of his death with a deeply moving message on X: *"I just confirmed what I refused to believe: Willie Colón has indeed passed. To his wife Julia, his children, family and loved ones, I send my heartfelt condolences."*

## *El Gran Varón*: The Song That Broke Taboos

In 1989, Colón released *El gran varón* by Omar Alfanno — one of the first Latin music songs to openly address HIV/AIDS and gender identity. The song tells the story of a father who rejects his gay son, then mourns him when he dies of AIDS. It was revolutionary for its time and remains so today.

Colón understood that music was also a political act. Throughout his career he ran for New York City Council and was deeply engaged in Latin American causes. His commitment sits alongside figures like [Susan Sarandon and Mark Ruffalo, who have also raised their voices on behalf of Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-10-susan-sarandon-mark-ruffalo-carta-trump-cuba/).

## A Legacy of 30 Million Records

Willie Colón left a monumental legacy that music history cannot ignore:

| Achievement | Figure |
|-------------|--------|
| Albums recorded | 32+ |
| Gold Records | 9 |
| Platinum Records | 5 |
| Grammy nominations | 8 |
| Records sold worldwide | 30 million+ |
| *Siembra* copies sold | 3 million+ |

His collaborations with **Héctor Lavoe**, **Rubén Blades**, **Celia Cruz**, and **Ismael Miranda** defined the salsa canon for generations. Songs like *Calle Luna, Calle Sol*, *La murga*, *Idilio*, *Gitana*, *Plástico*, and *Pedro Navaja* are the musical patrimony of all Latin America.

## Cuba Mourns One of Its Own

Although Willie Colón was Puerto Rican by birth, Cuba always felt him as its own. Cuban son lived in his trombone. The cadence of mambo and cha-cha-chá breathed in his arrangements. And Celia Cruz — the most Cuban voice in the world — chose him as a musical partner for four albums.

Cuba, which today faces one of its deepest crises — with [its healthcare system on the verge of collapse](/en/blog/2026-02-22-sistema-salud-cuba-borde-colapso-bloqueo/) and millions of Cubans resisting on the island and in the diaspora — knows what it means to lose giants.

At the Caribbean Series, where [Cuba staged epic comebacks against Curaçao](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-remontada-epica-serie-caribe-curazao/), the spirit of the Caribbean — of which Willie Colón was a guardian — continues to pulse. And it always will.

Rest in peace, Willie Colón. The Bronx was yours. Salsa was yours. And a piece of Cuba will always be, too.
