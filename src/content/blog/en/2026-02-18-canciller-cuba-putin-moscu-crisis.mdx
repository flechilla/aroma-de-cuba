In a high-stakes diplomatic move, Cuban Foreign Minister **Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla** met Wednesday in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister **Sergei Lavrov** and later with President **Vladimir Putin** at the Kremlin — the most significant Cuban diplomatic effort since the [energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz) intensified on the island.

## An Unannounced Trip With a Clear Message

Rodríguez's visit was not announced in advance, underscoring its urgency. At the start of his meeting with Lavrov, the Cuban diplomat was direct: *"We are ready for respectful dialogue on equal terms with any country,"* he said, leaving the door open for negotiations while setting the terms.

Rodríguez criticized Washington's policy toward Cuba, which has been declared a threat to US national security by [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/). He insisted that Cuba would defend its sovereignty and maintain its "unalterable" course despite the pressure.

## Lavrov Blasts Washington

The Russian foreign minister was blunt. He called US actions **"absolutely unacceptable"** and urged Washington to *"show common sense"* and abandon plans for a naval blockade of Cuba.

Lavrov lamented that the US decree escalated the threat designation by linking it to Cuba's cooperation with Russia, *"which is described in that decree as a hostile and malicious state."*

He described Cuba-Russia relations as historic and strategic, pledging that bilateral objectives would be achieved **"above any circumstances."**

## Meeting With Putin: "Special Importance"

Kremlin spokesperson **Dmitri Peskov** said the meeting with Putin carried *"special importance given the difficult times that our friendly and brotherly Cuba is going through."*

Peskov reiterated that Russia values its relationship with Cuba and intends to *"continue developing it and providing the corresponding assistance."* However, he ruled out any impact on [Ukraine negotiations](/en/blog/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo) underway in Geneva.

## Russian Oil for Cuba?

The big question is whether this visit will translate into concrete fuel shipments. Moscow has signaled that **oil supplies are planned**, but the last significant delivery was 100,000 tons of crude in February 2025.

Meanwhile, [Russian airlines suspended flights to Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba) and repatriated thousands of tourists due to the island's fuel shortage. The contradiction between diplomatic support and practical limitations defines the moment.

## A Complex Geopolitical Chessboard

The visit comes as the [US is already shipping fuel to Cuba via private channels](/en/blog/2026-02-18-eeuu-envios-combustible-cuba-licencias-privadas) through OFAC licenses, and as Trump confirmed that [Rubio is negotiating with Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo) toward a possible deal.

Cuba is playing multiple diplomatic boards simultaneously: after [meeting with Spain in Madrid](/en/blog/2026-02-15-cancilleres-cuba-espana-madrid) last week, Havana now seeks the backing of its historic ally in Moscow.

The lingering question: will Russia's rhetorical solidarity translate into actual barrels of oil?
