faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between Moros y Cristianos and Congrí?"
    answer: "Moros y Cristianos is made with black beans and is typical of western Cuba (Havana). Congrí uses red beans and is traditional in eastern Cuba (Santiago). The name Congrí comes from Haitian Creole: 'congó' (red beans) + 'riz' (rice)."
  - question: "Why is the dish called Moros y Cristianos (Moors and Christians)?"
    answer: "The name references the Spanish Reconquista (8th-15th centuries), when Christians fought against Muslim Moors on the Iberian Peninsula. The black beans represent the Moors and the white rice represents the Christians, symbolizing the fusion of cultures."
  - question: "How long does it take to make Moros y Cristianos?"
    answer: "With pre-cooked beans, the dish is ready in 35-40 minutes. If starting from scratch with dried beans, you'll need to soak them overnight and cook them for 1-2 hours before preparing the rice."
  - question: "What are the best side dishes for Moros y Cristianos?"
    answer: "Traditionally served with roast pork (lechón), yuca with garlic mojo sauce, tostones, or sweet fried plantains. It's the star accompaniment for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve dinners in Cuba."

On every Cuban table, from Havana to Santiago, there exists a dish that transcends mere gastronomy to become a symbol of national identity. **Moros y Cristianos** —that perfect union of black beans and white rice— tells the story of a people forged through the fusion of cultures in every single grain.

## A Story That Crosses Oceans

The dish's name transports us eight centuries back to the Iberian Peninsula, where Christians and Muslims (Moors) fought battles that would define Spain's destiny. The black beans, dark as the African night, represent the Moors; the white rice, luminous as European cathedrals, represents the Christians.

But the story doesn't end in Spain. Colonizers brought this culinary metaphor to the Caribbean, where it merged with African traditions that arrived on slave ships. The result was a mestizo dish, as Cuban as son music and as universal as the love for good food.

## Moros vs. Congrí: The Great Cuban Debate

Here's where many get confused, and where Cubans argue with passion:

| Feature | Moros y Cristianos | Congrí |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Beans** | Black | Red (kidney) |
| **Region** | Western Cuba (Havana) | Eastern Cuba (Santiago) |
| **Name origin** | Spanish Reconquista | Haitian Creole: "congó" + "riz" |
| **Flavor** | Milder, earthy | More intense, smoky |

Historian [Fernando Ortiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Ortiz), the father of Afro-Cuban studies, documented that the term "congrí" arrived from Haiti, where in Creole it literally means "red beans with rice."

## The Traditional Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 6)

**For the beans:**
- 2 cups dried black beans (or 4 cups pre-cooked)
- 1 bay leaf
- 6 cups water

**For the rice:**
- 2 cups long-grain rice
- 3 cups bean cooking liquid
- 4-6 tablespoons olive oil (or traditional lard)
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

**The day before:**
1. Soak the beans in cold water for 8-12 hours.

**Cooking day:**
1. **Cook the beans:** Drain and place in a large pot with fresh water and bay leaf. Simmer over medium-low heat for 1.5-2 hours until tender but not mushy. Reserve the cooking liquid.

2. **Make the sofrito:** In a large Dutch oven or caldero, heat the oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion and pepper until translucent (5-7 minutes). Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.

3. **Add the spices:** Stir in the cumin, oregano, and bay leaves. Cook until fragrant.

4. **Bring it together:** Add 2 cups of cooked beans, the rice, warm bean liquid, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Cook on high heat** until the liquid is partially absorbed. Reduce to low, cover tightly, and cook 20-25 minutes without lifting the lid.

6. **The final touch:** Let rest covered for 5 minutes. Before serving, fluff gently with a fork.

### Grandma's Secrets

- **The vinegar is key:** That little acid touch brightens all the flavors and helps keep the rice fluffy.
- **Don't over-stir:** Once you add the rice, stir only at the beginning. Then leave it alone.
- **The pot matters:** A traditional cast-iron caldero creates "pegao" (crispy rice at the bottom), considered a delicacy.
- **Lard for purists:** Nothing beats the flavor of traditional lard. Olive oil is the modern, healthier alternative.

## More Than a Dish: A Family Ritual

In Cuba, Moros y Cristianos aren't just food —they're the gravitational center of every celebration. On **Nochebuena** (Christmas Eve), they accompany roast pork with [yuca con mojo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuca_con_mojo). On **New Year's**, eating them is believed to bring prosperity (rice represents abundance, beans represent coins).

Every family has their version. Some add bacon or chicharrones for a more intense flavor. Others prefer the clean version, letting the beans and garlic be the stars. What matters isn't the exact recipe, but the ritual of cooking together, of passing tradition from generation to generation.
