faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between tostones and maduros?"
    answer: "Tostones are made from green plantains, fried twice for a crispy, savory result. Maduros use ripe plantains (with black skin), fried once for a sweet, soft texture."
  - question: "What kind of plantain is used for tostones?"
    answer: "Green cooking plantains (plátano macho) are used. They must be completely green with no yellow spots to achieve the characteristic crispy texture."
  - question: "How do you make tostones crispy?"
    answer: "The secret is double-frying: first fry them soft, then flatten with a tostonera or glass bottom, and fry again at higher temperature until golden."
  - question: "Can maduros be baked instead of fried?"
    answer: "Yes, baked maduros are a healthier alternative. Place on a greased baking sheet at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through."

At any self-respecting Cuban table, alongside rice and beans, you'll find one of the two great protagonists of fried plantain: **tostones** or **maduros**. These two dishes, seemingly simple, hold centuries of culinary history and represent the essence of Creole cooking.

## The Plantain: African Heritage in the Caribbean

The plantain arrived in the Caribbean with the Spanish, but it was African slaves who transformed it into a pillar of Cuban cuisine. Unlike the sweet banana we eat as fruit, the **cooking plantain** requires heat and is used like a vegetable.

From this versatile ingredient come two opposite but complementary preparations: tostones (from green plantains) and maduros (from ripe plantains). Each has its moment, its texture, and its role at the table.

## Tostones: The Art of Double-Frying

Tostones, also known as **chatinos** in eastern Cuba or **patacones** in other countries, are medallions of green plantain fried twice until crispy on the outside and tender inside.

### Traditional Tostones Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 large green plantains
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt to taste
- Garlic water (optional)

**Preparation:**

1. **Peel the plantains** - Green plantains have tough skin. Make a lengthwise cut and carefully remove the peel.

2. **Cut into rounds** - Cut into 1.5-inch (3-4 cm) pieces, diagonal or straight.

3. **First fry** - In oil at medium temperature (320°F/160°C), fry the pieces for 3-4 minutes until soft but not golden.

4. **Flatten** - Remove and flatten each piece with a tostonera, the bottom of a glass, or between two plates. Some briefly soak them in garlic water.

5. **Second fry** - Raise the oil temperature (350°F/180°C) and fry the flattened tostones until golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.

6. **Season** - Drain on paper towels and salt immediately.

### The Secret of Mojo

In Cuba, tostones are frequently served with **mojo criollo**: a sauce of mashed garlic, sour orange juice, olive oil, and cumin. This combination of hot toston with fresh mojo is [a perfect pairing](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218439/tostones-fried-plantains/) that elevates the dish.

## Maduros: Caramelized Sweetness

Maduros represent the other end of the spectrum. Here the plantain must be very ripe, with almost completely black skin. At this point, the starches have converted to sugars, giving that characteristic sweet flavor.

### Perfect Maduros Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 very ripe plantains (black skin)
- Oil for frying
- Cinnamon (optional)

**Preparation:**

1. **Peel** - Ripe peel comes off easily by hand.

2. **Cut** - In diagonal slices of 0.5-1 inch (1-2 cm), or in long strips for **mariquitas**.

3. **Fry** - In oil at medium-high temperature (340°F/170°C), fry until edges are caramelized and golden, about 2-3 minutes per side.

4. **Serve** - Maduros don't need salt. Some sprinkle cinnamon for desserts.

### The Perfect Ripeness

The secret to good maduros lies in plantain ripeness. According to [Caribbean gastronomy experts](https://www.seriouseats.com/cuban-maduros-recipe-fried-sweet-plantains), the ideal plantain has:
- Black skin with some yellow
- Flesh that yields slightly to pressure
- Perceptible sweet aroma

## When to Serve Each One

In Cuban tradition, there are unwritten rules:

- **Tostones** - Accompany savory, hearty dishes: [roast pork](/en/blog/2026-02-11-lechon-asado-cubano/), [ropa vieja](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ropa-vieja-plato-nacional-cuba-receta-historia/), fried fish, picadillo.

- **Maduros** - Go with [moros y cristianos](/en/blog/2026-02-11-moros-y-cristianos/), roast chicken, or alone as a sweet side. They also appear in the famous **Cuban complete plate**.

## Regional Variations

While tostones and maduros are universal in Cuba, each region has its touches:

- **Eastern Cuba** - Chatinos are thicker and served with spicy mojo.
- **Havana** - Thinner, crispier tostones, chip-style.
- **Camagüey** - Maduros baked with grated cheese on top.

## Plantains in the Diaspora

In Miami, Tampa, and other cities with Cuban communities, tostones and maduros maintain their sacred place. Restaurants like [Versailles](https://www.versaillesrestaurant.com/) on Calle 8 in Miami serve mountains of perfect tostones that transport any Cuban straight to their grandmother's table.
