faq:
  - question: "What did Marco Rubio say about Cuba's economy?"
    answer: "At the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said Cuba's willingness to open its economy would be 'a possible way forward,' marking a shift from his administration's more confrontational stance."
  - question: "Why is this change in tone significant?"
    answer: "Until now, the Trump administration had maintained an oil blockade without offering clear alternatives. Rubio's mention of economic opening as a solution suggests a possible softening of the US approach toward Cuba."
  - question: "Did Rubio mention the oil blockade on Cuba?"
    answer: "No. Rubio blamed Cuba's crisis on the government's economic incompetence and the end of foreign subsidies, without acknowledging the impact of US sanctions or the oil blockade imposed by his own administration."
  - question: "Are there ongoing negotiations between the US and Cuba?"
    answer: "Trump has claimed his government is in dialogue with Havana, while Cuban authorities acknowledge only 'exchanges of messages.' Rubio did not provide details about any negotiations during his Munich remarks."

In a notable departure from his usual rhetoric on Cuba, US Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** suggested Saturday that an economic opening on the island could be "a possible way forward" amid the deepening crisis in the Caribbean nation.

## A Shift in Tone from Munich

During an interview with [Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVvfjAf4ntM) following his address at the **Munich Security Conference**, Rubio was asked whether there was any way out for the Cuban government while Washington maintains an [oil blockade on the island](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals/).

"I think certainly their willingness to begin to open up in that regard is a possible way to move forward," the Secretary of State replied — a significant nuance compared to the hardline approach that has defined the Trump administration's Cuba policy in recent weeks.

## The Economy as the Core Problem

Rubio framed his analysis around Cuba's economic structure, arguing that "the fundamental problem in Cuba is they don't have an economy" and that its rulers "don't know how to make the everyday life of their people better without giving up power over the sectors they control."

"It's important that the Cuban people have more freedom, not just political freedom, but economic freedom as well," the Cuban-American politician emphasized, according to the [official State Department transcript](https://www.state.gov/translations/spanish/entrevista-del-secretario-de-estado-de-ee-uu-marco-rubio-con-john-micklethwait-de-bloomberg-news).

## Rejected "Opportunities"

The top US diplomat claimed Cuban authorities have been offered "opportunities" they have failed to accept, though he did not specify whether he was referring to recent negotiations or previous moments in bilateral relations.

"They'd rather be in charge of the country than allow it to prosper," Rubio stated, insisting that Cuba's economic model "doesn't work and has never worked anywhere else in the world."

It's worth noting that [Trump has repeatedly claimed](/en/blog/2026-02-16-cuba-crisis-diplomatica-negociaciones-secretas/) his government is in dialogue with Havana, while Cuban authorities have acknowledged only "exchanges of messages."

## What Rubio Didn't Say

Notably absent from his remarks was any reference to the **impact of US sanctions** and the oil blockade imposed after the [capture of Nicolás Maduro](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade/) on January 3. Rubio attributed the crisis solely to the Cuban government's incompetence and the end of subsidies from allied nations.

## Context: An Island at Breaking Point

The comments come at a critical moment for Cuba, which is facing:

- [Record blackouts affecting 64% of the country](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/)
- [Mass cancellation of international flights](/en/blog/2026-02-14-cubana-aviacion-recorta-vuelos-madrid/) due to fuel shortages
- [Cancellation of the Festival del Habano](/en/blog/2026-02-15-festival-habano-cancelado-crisis/) and other events
- [Fire at the Ñico López refinery](/en/blog/2026-02-14-incendio-refineria-nico-lopez-habana/) in Havana

Meanwhile, the Cuban government has opted to [revive its "War of All the People" military doctrine](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/el-gobierno-cubano-desempolva-su-guerra-de-todo-el-pueblo-ante-la-presion-de-eeuu/), with weekly defensive exercises against what it considers a possible US military aggression.

The question that remains is whether Rubio's words in Munich represent a genuine policy shift or merely a rhetorical adjustment while the siege on Cuba continues.
