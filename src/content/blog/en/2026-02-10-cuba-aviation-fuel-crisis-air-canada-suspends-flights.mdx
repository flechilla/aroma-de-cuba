Cuba's ongoing energy crisis has reached a critical new point: **the government informed international airlines that there is no aviation fuel available** at the country's ten main airports.

## Air Canada Halts Operations

The most drastic response came from **Air Canada**, Canada's largest airline, which announced a **complete suspension of flights until May 1st**. The company will organize an operation to repatriate approximately 3,000 customers stranded on the island.

Business sources cited by [El País](https://elpais.com/economia/2026-02-10/la-salida-de-air-canada-da-la-puntilla-al-turismo-en-cuba-y-enciende-las-alertas-en-melia-e-iberostar.html) estimate the number of affected people at 21,000 between tourists and residents, representing "more than 50% of the tourism on the island right now."

## Spanish Airlines Seek Alternatives

Iberia and Air Europa have decided to make **technical stops in Santo Domingo** (Dominican Republic) to refuel, avoiding dependence on Cuban supplies. Iberia is also offering customers date changes, vouchers, or refunds.

## Tourism Impact

Cuban tourism was already in freefall:

- **2018**: 5 million visitors (all-time high)
- **2025**: 1.8 million tourists (-64% in seven years)
- **January-September 2025**: 1.37 million (-20.5% year-over-year)

Spanish chains **Meliá** (34 hotels) and **Iberostar** (20 hotels) face extremely difficult conditions. Meliá has temporarily closed three hotels and reports 40.2% occupancy versus its global average of 62.3%.

## Political Context

The crisis deepened after [U.S. tariff threats](https://elpais.com/america/2026-02-09/cuba-advierte-a-las-lineas-areas-internacionales-que-a-partir-del-lunes-se-queda-sin-combustible-para-la-aviacion.html) against countries supplying oil to Cuba. **Mexico suspended shipments** and Venezuela stopped being a supplier after January events.

President Miguel Díaz-Canel has expressed willingness to dialogue with the United States and announced a contingency plan similar to the "Special Period" of the 1990s.

**Russia** has indicated it will seek ways to help its ally, though without concrete details. There are currently about 4,000 Russian tourists on the island.
