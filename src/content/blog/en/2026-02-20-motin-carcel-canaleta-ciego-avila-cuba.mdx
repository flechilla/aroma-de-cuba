A violent riot erupted at **Canaleta high-security prison** in Ciego de Ávila, leaving at least **seven dead and dozens injured**, according to NGOs [Prisoners Defenders](https://www.prisonersdefenders.org/) and the Cuban Prisons Documentation Center (CDPC). Cuban authorities have remained completely silent on the events.

## What happened at Canaleta

According to inmate testimonies obtained by [Spain's EFE news agency](https://efe.com/mundo/2026-02-19/cuba-motin-carcel-alta-seguridad-ciego-avila/), both political and common prisoners revolted in the early hours of Thursday, chanting **"Freedom"**, **"Patria y Vida"** (Homeland and Life), and slogans against President Díaz-Canel.

The reasons behind the uprising were clear: **hunger, abuse, and inhumane conditions** inside the facility.

Authorities responded with force. Police reinforcements were deployed using:

- **Rubber bullets**
- **Pepper spray**
- **Physical violence**

Prisoners Defenders [reported on social media](https://www.facebook.com/reel/2055291555015616) that witnesses saw **"seven coffins leaving the prison"**, while [other outlets](https://www.telemundo51.com/video/noticiero-t51/tres-muertos-y-protestas-durante-motin-en-carcel-cubana/2752840/) cite lower death tolls. Injured inmates were reportedly transferred to nearby hospitals.

## Official silence

As of publication, **neither the Cuban government nor state media** have issued any statement about the riot. They have not confirmed or denied the reports from NGOs and international media including [ABC](https://www.abc.es/internacional/siete-muertos-motin-prision-cuba-20260220095442-nt_amp.html) and [Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2026/02/20/motin-en-una-prision-de-maxima-seguridad-de-cuba-ong-aseguran-que-la-reyerta-se-origino-por-la-represion-y-los-abusos/).

The Mexico-based CDPC has demanded **"urgent official information"** on the health status of Canaleta inmates.

## Canaleta's troubling track record

The Canaleta prison has been the subject of multiple human rights complaints, including:

- **Extreme overcrowding and unsanitary conditions**
- **Insufficient food** in both quality and quantity
- **Precarious medical care**
- **Internal corruption**
- **Political repression** against prisoners

## A crisis within a crisis

The riot comes as Cuba faces its [worst crisis in decades](/en/blog/2026-02-20-cuba-preparada-bloqueo-total-onu). The [U.S. oil blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-20-sector-privado-importa-combustible-cuba) has worsened food and fuel shortages across the island — conditions that are inevitably felt inside prisons.

This Friday, Cuba's state electric utility forecasted blackouts affecting **56% of the country** simultaneously during peak hours, with an estimated deficit of 1,738 MW — yet another sign of how deep the crisis runs.
