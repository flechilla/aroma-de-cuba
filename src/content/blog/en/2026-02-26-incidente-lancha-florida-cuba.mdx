Cuba's Ministry of the Interior (MININT) reported on Thursday a serious naval incident on the northern coast of Villa Clara province, where four individuals lost their lives following an alleged confrontation with Cuban border troops. The vessel involved, a speedboat, carried a registration from the state of Florida, United States.

## Details of the Incident in Villa Clara
According to the official statement, the interception took place in the early hours near Cayo Falcones. Cuban authorities claim that the vessel executed aggressive maneuvers in an attempt to evade detention, leading to an armed response from Cuban security forces.

Four crew members were on board the boat, all of whom died during the event. The Cuban government has launched an investigation to determine the mission's objectives, while segments of civil society and international media have begun to question the official narrative due to a lack of immediate visual evidence.

### Diplomatic Fallout and Tensions
