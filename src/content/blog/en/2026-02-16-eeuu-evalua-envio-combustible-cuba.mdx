The U.S. administration is analyzing a measure that could mark a turning point in bilateral relations: the possible shipment of fuel to Cuba in reduced quantities under a strictly humanitarian framework.

## A Limited but Significant Plan

According to [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/), the plan envisions a limited supply of **cooking gas** and **diesel for Cuba's drinking water system**.

This would not be a massive oil shipment. The idea is to cover basic needs that currently face frequent interruptions, directly affecting the lives of millions of Cubans.

The [energy crisis gripping Cuba](/en/blog/cuba-crisis-diplomatica-negociaciones-secretas/) has caused **daily blackouts** and severe difficulties in essential services like water pumping and public transportation.

## Marco Rubio's Role

Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** could play a significant role in this initiative. Some observers believe the measure would aim to prevent further humanitarian deterioration without implying any relaxation of the embargo.

The potential shipment would open a new chapter in the debate over the real effects of the embargo and the relationship between political pressure and humanitarian crisis.

## Russia: Willingness Without Capacity

While Washington deliberates, **Russia has reiterated its willingness** to provide material assistance to Cuba. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stated that Moscow would continue offering support.

However, energy analyst **Igor Yushkov** warns that Russia is in no position to send large volumes of oil at no cost. Any Russian aid would likely be limited to kerosene for Russian tourists on the island — far from a solution to Cuba's structural energy problems.

## An Island at the Breaking Point

Cuba faces what many are already comparing to a new [Special Period](https://elpais.com/america/2026-02-15/cuba-teme-que-la-crisis-actual-la-devuelva-al-periodo-especial-de-los-anos-noventa.html). Blackouts stretch for hours, public transit runs intermittently, and fuel shortages impact everything from hospitals to food distribution.

Washington's pressure — including [threats of tariffs against countries supplying oil to Cuba](http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2026/02/15/que-trae-la-prensa-cubana-domingo-15-de-febrero-de-2026/) — has strangled traditional supply sources, including Venezuelan and Mexican oil.

Meanwhile, the possibility of a limited humanitarian shipment from the United States generates both hope and skepticism on an island that has learned to distrust promises from the north.
