## The Golden Era Comes to an End

After decades of unique migratory privileges, Cubans in the United States face an unprecedented reality: the **systematic elimination of protections** that distinguished them from other migrants. The Trump administration has suspended humanitarian programs and immigration processes specific to Cuban citizens, marking a historic break in Cuba-US migration relations.

The most dramatic change was evidenced on February 9, when **170 Cubans were deported** on the first ICE flight to Cuba in 2026. Among them, individuals convicted of serious crimes including murder, rape, and kidnapping, signaling that the automatic protection that characterized US migration policy toward the island for decades no longer exists.

## End of Special Status

### Suspension of Humanitarian Programs

According to reports from [El País](https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-17/the-future-of-many-cubans-in-the-us-depends-on-a-long-legal-saga.html), the new administration has:

- **Eliminated protections and humanitarian programs** for Cubans
- **Suspended immigration processes** established over decades
- Implemented a policy of **"detention and deportation"** previously unthinkable

"The detention and deportation of Cubans—something unimaginable until recently given their historical advantage under the Cuban Adjustment Act—is now a daily reality," explains the latest legal analysis.

### "Maximum Pressure" Strategy

The change is part of a **"maximum pressure" strategy** that the Trump administration implemented since January 2025, significantly tightening economic sanctions against Cuba and eliminating the migratory escape valves that traditionally relieved tensions.

## The New Reality for Cubans

### Who Remains Protected?

With the elimination of protections, only a reduced group maintains preferential status:

1. **Cubans who physically arrived** before January 2017 ("wet foot, dry foot" policy)
2. **Pending Cuban Adjustment Act cases** with complete documentation
3. **Asylum seekers** with cases in process before restrictions

### I-220A in Jeopardy

Approximately **500,000 Cubans with I-220A forms** face total legal uncertainty. A class action case in the 11th Circuit Court could determine their future, but prospects are grim under the new zero-tolerance policy.

## Impactful Numbers

### Deportations by Numbers
- **170 deported** in February 2026 (first flight)
- **116 deported** in subsequent flight
- **Total: 286 Cubans** deported in less than a month

### Mass Detentions
ICE reports a **340% increase in Cuban detentions** compared to the same period in 2025, evidencing aggressive implementation of the new policy.

## Geopolitical Context

### Economic Crisis in Cuba

The elimination of protections coincides with Cuba's worst economic crisis in decades:

- **Population reduced to 8 million** after massive exodus
- **Cuban peso** at historic low (500 per dollar)
- **Constant blackouts** and collapse of basic services

### Cuban Regime Response

For the first time in its history, **Cuba accepted deportees with criminal records**, signaling a change in its traditional migration policy of rejecting such cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What options do Cubans with deportation orders have?

Cubans with deportation orders can:
- Request **case review** with specialized attorney
- Apply for **immigration waiver** if they qualify
- Seek **asylum** or **protection against torture** if they demonstrate persecution
- Consider **voluntary departure** to avoid re-entry prohibition

### Is the Cuban Adjustment Act still in effect?

The Cuban Adjustment Act is **technically still in effect**, but its benefits are **severely limited** under new policies. Only Cubans meeting very specific requirements can apply.

### Can they deport Cubans without criminal records?

**Yes.** The new policy eliminates automatic protection. Cubans without legal status can be deported regardless of their background, marking a radical change from decades of migration practice.

### What should Cubans with I-220A do?

- **Consult immediately** with immigration attorney
- **Document** all evidence of arrival and stay
- **Monitor** the class action case in the 11th Circuit
- **Avoid** any contact with ICE without legal representation

## Legal Analysis

### Historic Precedent

The elimination of protections for Cubans establishes an **unprecedented precedent** in US migration history. Never before had an administration so dramatically reversed migration policies established for over 60 years.

### Impact on Future Cases

Legal experts predict this policy could:
- **Reduce by 90%** successful Cuban asylum applications
- **Increase deportations** by 400% during 2026
- **Create humanitarian crisis** in Cuba receiving mass deportees

## The Human Factor

### Family Separation

New policies are **separating families** that for decades lived with the tranquility of Cuban special status. Recent testimonies document the trauma of separations where some members have legal protection and others face immediate deportation.

### Psychological Impact

Psychologists specializing in migration trauma report a **250% increase** in consultations from Cubans with severe anxiety related to deportation fears.

## What's Coming

### Potential Negotiations

Reports suggest the Trump administration maintains **secret negotiations** with Cuban representatives to establish a "migration agreement" that could regularize deportations and create new legal channels.

### Legislative Pressure

Congress is evaluating **modifications to the Cuban Adjustment Act** that could codify current restrictions or, alternatively, restore protections under certain conditions.

## Community Recommendations

### Immediate Action
1. **Urgent legal consultation** to review immigration status
2. **Complete documentation** of all pending processes
3. **Family contingency plan** in case of deportation
4. **Contact support organizations** for immigration assistance

### Legal Preparation
- Maintain **all immigration documentation** updated
- **Avoid contact** with authorities without representation
- **Establish fund** for emergency legal expenses
