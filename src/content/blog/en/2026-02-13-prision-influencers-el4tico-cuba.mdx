The Holguín Provincial Prosecutor's Office confirmed Thursday that **Ernesto Ricardo Medina and Kamil Zayas Pérez**, the two young creators behind the digital project **El4tico** (el cuartico, meaning "the little room"), will remain in **provisional prison** while investigations continue.

## The Charges: Up to 8 Years Behind Bars

According to an official statement, both influencers are under investigation for **propaganda against the constitutional order** and **incitement to commit crimes**. The first charge carries up to eight years in prison; the second, up to 18 months under Cuba's Penal Code.

The Prosecutor's Office claimed that El4tico's publications "incite the people, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the Ministry of the Interior to change the constitutional order" and "defame the actions of the country's political and social institutions."

## The Little Room That Shook Social Media

El4tico quickly became a sensation among young Cubans through **video editorials** filmed in a small room with peeling walls, an old whiteboard, and a Chinese fan — the "cuartico" that gave the project its name. Their fresh, direct language resonated with thousands of followers who found in their videos a voice that reflected the daily frustrations of life in today's Cuba.

Medina and Zayas were **detained on January 6, 2026** in Holguín, more than 700 kilometers from Havana. Their families and supporters say they were **held incommunicado** for weeks.

## Habeas Corpus Denied at Hearing

A hearing was held Thursday at the **Holguín Provincial People's Court** following a habeas corpus petition filed by activist **Yanet Rodríguez Sánchez**. However, State Security agents **prevented Rodríguez Sánchez from reaching the courthouse**.

Despite the harassment, independent media reported the presence of young people and activists gathered outside the court in support of the detainees.

## International Condemnation

**Amnesty International** responded sharply to the judicial decision: *"Using broad criminal statutes to imprison content creators sends a chilling message to all citizens: expressing your opinion can cost you your freedom."*

The NGO **Ciudadanía y Libertad** (Citizenship and Freedom) demanded "real transparency in the proceedings, effective guarantees for the defense, and the immediate release of Medina and Zayas, as well as all persons imprisoned for political reasons in Cuba."

## Repression Amid Crisis

The El4tico case comes against a backdrop of [Cuba's deepening multisystemic crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/), with blackouts affecting over 64% of the country, an [unprecedented fuel shortage](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-sin-combustible-aviacion-air-canada-suspende-vuelos/), and escalating tensions between Washington and Havana.

Human rights organizations warn of a **repressive escalation** linked to growing U.S. pressure and recent events in Venezuela. Medina's wife, Doris Santiesteban, wrote on social media: *"Don't let the fight stop. Not just for them, but for the freedom of all political prisoners and for a free Cuba."*
