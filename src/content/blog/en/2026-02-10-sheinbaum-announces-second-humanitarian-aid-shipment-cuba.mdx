Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Sunday that a second humanitarian aid shipment will be sent to Cuba in the coming days, reiterating her country's solidarity with the Cuban people amid the energy and economic crisis gripping the island.

## "Mexico Is Supportive"

"Mexico is always supportive and cannot ignore the sanctions against Cuba. Food was sent, more will be sent, and we will provide whatever support is needed," Sheinbaum declared during her morning press conference.

The president also condemned the tariffs the United States has threatened to impose on countries supplying oil to Cuba, describing them as measures that directly harm the people.

"Such sanctions are wrong because they leave them without fuel for their activities, and the people suffer," she added.

## Seeking Alternatives for Oil

Although [Mexico has halted its crude oil shipments to Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade) due to Trump's threats, Sheinbaum assured that her government is seeking ways to resume supply.

"Mexico will do whatever is necessary to have the sanctions lifted against countries that send crude to Cuba," she stated.

## First Shipment Already Delivered

The first Mexican humanitarian aid shipment to Cuba was delivered in early February, according to [El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/2026/02/09/claudia-sheinbaum-mananera-temas-hoy-9-de-febrero-de-2026-en-vivo/). The shipments include food and other basic supplies.

## Context: Cuba in Crisis

Mexican aid arrives at a critical moment for Cuba, which faces:

- [International flight suspensions due to fuel shortage](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights)
- [Emergency measures including university closures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals)

Mexican solidarity represents important support for the Cuban population, although the lack of oil remains the central problem of the current crisis.
