In a gesture Havana calls contradictory, the United States government announced **$6 million in humanitarian aid** for Cuba while maintaining an oil blockade that threatens to trigger a humanitarian crisis on the island.

## Aid Includes Food and Hygiene Products

According to the Trump Administration, the new assistance adds to the $3 million sent in January to help families affected by Hurricane Melissa.

The aid includes tens of thousands of units of basic products:
- Hygiene kits
- Non-perishable foods (pasta, rice, canned tuna, beans)

The products will be shipped from Miami and distributed through local parishes, primarily in eastern Cuba.

## "Hypocritical," Cuba Responds

Havana's response was immediate and forceful. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs **Carlos Fernández de Cossío** wrote on X:

> "Quite hypocritical to apply draconian coercive measures denying basic economic conditions to millions and then announce soup and cans for a few."

## Washington Denies Blockade Causes Crisis

Acting Undersecretary of State Jeremy Lewin rejected that oil restrictions are amplifying the humanitarian crisis. He argued that Cuba is still affected by Hurricane Melissa and accused the Cuban government of hoarding available fuel.

"The idea that some change in recent weeks regarding oil is responsible for what's happening in Cuba is simply not true," he stated.

He also noted that products would be delivered pre-packaged to prevent "regime interference."

## Cuba Without Fuel Since December

President Miguel Díaz-Canel confirmed that Cuba has not received fuel from abroad since December due to US pressure.

Following Nicolás Maduro's capture on January 3, Venezuelan supply was interrupted. Trump's subsequent executive order threatening tariffs on countries sending oil to Cuba has closed other supply routes.

Experts estimate Cuba needs about **110,000 barrels daily** to meet its energy demand. Venezuela was providing about 30,000 barrels daily.

## International Condemnation

Several countries have condemned the US measure, arguing it could trigger a humanitarian crisis. These include Russia, China, Mexico, and Venezuela itself.
