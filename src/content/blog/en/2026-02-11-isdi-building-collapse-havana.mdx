Part of the former Instituto Superior de Diseño (ISDi) building collapsed early Tuesday morning, February 11, exactly one year after its previous collapse and amid ongoing demolition plans that remain incomplete.

## The Collapse

According to social media reports, the collapse occurred around 1:00 AM on the side facing Maloja Street in Centro Habana. The building had already suffered a previous collapse on San Carlos Street and poses **immediate danger toward Belascoaín Street**, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the capital.

According to journalist Lázaro Manuel Alonso, the collapsed area had been declared in a state of imminent collapse for four months, when workers from the GECAL company began progressive demolition of the structure. Fortunately, no casualties were reported.

## A History of Deterioration

The 165-year-old historic building closed its doors in 2022 due to a complex architectural failure. The causes of deterioration include:

- **Inadequate structural modifications**: Two new levels and a theater were added to the original structure
- **Overloading**: The original beam and board mezzanines could not support the new reinforced concrete floors
- **Lack of maintenance**: Over a century without proper repairs

"Having two different types of construction—the beam and board mezzanines and the reinforced concrete floors above—overloaded the structure significantly," explained engineer Ramón Casado Morales, project director at Servicios Especializados de la Construcción.

## New Home for ISDi

In August 2025, the Instituto Superior de Diseño announced its relocation to a new facility at the intersection of 1st and 32nd streets in Playa municipality. The reorganization process, coordinated by the Ministry of Education and the central government, enabled the transfer of a building that previously housed a Polytechnic Institute.

During the 2025-2026 academic year, classes have continued in alternative spaces while construction work was carried out at the new facility.

## ISDi's Legacy

The Instituto Superior de Diseño Industrial y de Comunicación Visual has trained more than 3,000 professionals since its founding. It was officially established as a Higher Education Center on May 28, 1984, and opened its doors in October of that year with just 50 students.

The collapse of the historic building is another reminder of the **dire state of Havana's architectural heritage**, where thousands of buildings face similar structural problems due to decades of underinvestment in maintenance.
