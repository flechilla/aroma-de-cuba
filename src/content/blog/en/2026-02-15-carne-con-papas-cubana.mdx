faq:
  - question: "What cut of beef is best for Cuban carne con papas?"
    answer: "Chuck roast is the ideal cut, as its marbling keeps the meat moist and tender during slow cooking. Beef stew meat or shoulder cuts also work well when diced into cubes."
  - question: "Who was Nitza Villapol and why is she important to Cuban cooking?"
    answer: "Nitza Villapol hosted 'Cocina al Minuto,' Cuba's longest-running television cooking show for over 40 years. Her cookbook is considered the bible of Cuban cuisine, and her recipes remain the standard for home cooks across the island and diaspora."
  - question: "How long does carne con papas take to cook?"
    answer: "Total cooking time is 1.5 to 2 hours on low heat. The beef needs at least one hour to become tender, and potatoes are added in the last 30 minutes so they hold their shape."
  - question: "Can you make carne con papas in a slow cooker?"
    answer: "Yes, brown the beef and sauté the sofrito first, then transfer everything to a slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or HIGH for 3-4 hours. Add potatoes in the last hour for best results."

Some Cuban dishes steal the spotlight — [lechón asado](/en/blog/2026-02-11-lechon-asado-cubano/), [arroz imperial](/en/blog/2026-02-12-arroz-imperial-cubano/) — and some quietly feed the soul. **Carne con papas** belongs to the second group: the everyday stews that nourished generations, stretched with water when meat was scarce, and remain the first dish many Cubans learn to cook.

## A Stew With Deep Roots

Cuban carne con papas descends directly from the Spanish estofados brought to the Caribbean during colonial times. The sofrito of garlic, onion, and pepper — that [Creole trinity](https://en.cocina-cubana.com/recetas/main-course/meat-with-potatoes) defining island cooking — transformed the Iberian stew into something new: lighter for the tropical climate, seasoned with cumin and bay leaf, enriched with dry wine and tomato sauce.

Unlike more elaborate dishes like [ajiaco](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ajiaco-cubano/) (which calls for multiple root vegetables and meats), carne con papas is a dish of domestic economy. Two main ingredients, an honest sofrito, and time. Nothing more.

## Nitza Villapol's Classic Recipe

You can't talk about carne con papas without mentioning **Nitza Villapol**, the undisputed queen of Cuban cooking. Her show *[Cocina al Minuto](https://www.cuballama.com/blog/la-receta-de-carne-con-papas-de-nitza-villapol/)*, broadcast for over 40 years on Cuban television, taught millions to cook with whatever was available.

Her classic version included:

### Ingredients (Serves 6-8)

- **2 lbs beef** (chuck roast or shoulder), cut into cubes
- **2 lbs potatoes**, peeled and cubed
- **1/2 cup oil** for searing
- **1 large onion**, finely diced
- **3 garlic cloves**, crushed
- **1 bell pepper**, diced
- **1 can tomato sauce** (8 oz)
- **1 cup dry cooking wine** (vino seco)
- **1 cup water**
- **1 cup alcaparrado** (stuffed olives and capers mix)
- **1 bay leaf**
- **Salt, pepper, cumin, and paprika** to taste

### Instructions

1. **Sear the beef** in hot oil until browned on all sides. This step builds flavor through the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction).
2. **Add the sofrito**: diced onion, garlic, and pepper. Cook until the onion is translucent.
3. **Add seasonings**: salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, and bay leaf.
4. **Pour in the tomato sauce, wine, and water**. Stir well to combine.
5. **Simmer on low heat** for about one hour until the beef is halfway cooked.
6. **Add the potatoes and alcaparrado**. If more liquid is needed, add water and a splash more wine.
7. **Continue cooking on low** until potatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened.

> **Nitza's tip**: If the sauce reduces too much before the meat is done, add hot water (never cold) to avoid stopping the cooking process.

## The Art of Stretching a Stew

During the [Special Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period) of the 1990s, when Cuba faced a devastating economic crisis, carne con papas became an exercise in creativity. Less meat, more potatoes. Sometimes no meat at all. Cuban families learned to work miracles with a strong sofrito and well-seasoned potatoes.

That spirit of resourcefulness lives on. In Miami, Madrid, or any kitchen in the Cuban diaspora, carne con papas is cooked with the same philosophy: **nothing is wasted, everything is transformed**.

## Regional Variations

- **Eastern Cuba**: spicier, with extra ají cachucha peppers and sometimes a splash of [sour orange](https://asassyspoon.com/carne-con-papas/)
- **Havana**: the classic version with dry wine and alcaparrado
- **The diaspora**: adapted with American chuck roast, often cooked in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours
- **Pressure cooker**: the quick version for working families, ready in 40 minutes

## Perfect Pairings

Carne con papas is never eaten alone. The mandatory companion is **white rice** — that fluffy, separated Cuban rice that soaks up the stew's sauce like a sponge. Complete the plate with:

- [Fried sweet plantains](/en/blog/2026-02-12-platanos-maduros-fritos-cubanos/) — the sweet-savory contrast is essential
- Avocado salad with onion and lime
- [Cuban bread](/en/blog/2026-02-12-pan-cubano-historia-receta/) to clean the plate

## More Than a Recipe

Carne con papas is the dish your grandmother made when you came home from school. It's the Tuesday dinner when there was nothing special to celebrate, except being together. It's Cuba at its most honest: no frills, no pretensions, but full of flavor.

In every Cuban kitchen around the world, the aroma of sofrito browning in hot oil is a signal that everything is going to be all right. At least for tonight.
