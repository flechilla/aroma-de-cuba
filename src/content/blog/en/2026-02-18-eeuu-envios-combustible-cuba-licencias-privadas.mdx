    answer: "According to private sector sources consulted by CiberCuba, approximately 10 fuel tankers have arrived in Cuba from the United States through current federal licenses."

    answer: "No. These are private commercial operations carried out by authorized companies under OFAC licenses, not direct agreements between governments."
  - question: "Do these shipments solve Cuba's energy crisis?"
    answer: "Not immediately. The volumes are limited and insufficient to reverse widespread blackouts or transportation shortages, but they set an important commercial precedent."

    answer: "UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for dialogue among all parties to prevent the crisis from worsening, noting the General Assembly has repeatedly rejected the US embargo on Cuba."

As Cuba endures its worst [energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz) in decades, a surprising development has emerged: **at least 10 fuel tankers carrying American fuel have already arrived on the island** through private commercial channels.

## Federal Licenses, Not Government Deals

According to private sector sources consulted by [CiberCuba](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-17-u1-e129488-s27061-nid321050-pequenos-envios-combustible-cuba-eeuu-abren-nuevo), the operations are being conducted under **current OFAC federal licenses** (Office of Foreign Assets Control, US Treasury Department).

These are not direct agreements between Washington and Havana, but rather **commercial schemes where authorized US companies export fuel**, while Cuban state-enabled importing entities facilitate the operations on the island's side.

Cuban importing companies act as intermediaries within the island's centralized commercial system, which concentrates strategic imports under state control.

## Limited Volumes, Symbolic Impact

The shipments are described as **limited in volume**. Analysts agree the quantities are not enough to reverse the widespread shortages affecting public transportation, the private sector, and electricity generation.

Cuba has been struggling for months with an [energy deficit that has left 64% of the country without electricity](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba), worsened by:

- Declining Venezuelan supplies
- [Mexico cutting oil shipments](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade) for the first time in a decade
- Difficulties accessing international financing
- The [oil blockade imposed by Trump](/en/blog/2026-02-16-eeuu-evalua-envio-combustible-cuba)

However, these operations **set a precedent**: they demonstrate that, under certain legal and commercial conditions, limited energy flows can materialize between the two countries.

## Guterres Calls for Dialogue

Meanwhile, **UN Secretary-General António Guterres** expressed concern about the deteriorating situation and called for dialogue among all parties, according to his spokesperson [Stéphane Dujarric](https://efe.com/mundo/2026-02-16/antonio-guterres-onu-alerta-crisis-energetica-cuba-llamado-dialogo/).

"The Secretary-General is concerned about the situation, which is worsening," Dujarric stated, recalling that the UN General Assembly has repeatedly expressed its rejection of the US embargo.

The UN has teams working on the ground alongside the Cuban government to support the humanitarian response.

## The South Florida Debate

The topic has generated controversy among Cuban exile sectors:

- **Critics** argue any fuel transaction could indirectly benefit Cuba's state apparatus
- **Supporters** contend that private actor involvement and specific licenses create distinct economic spaces

The main obstacle to scaling these operations is logistical: **transporting large volumes requires maritime insurance, complex contracts, and banking support** — all more costly and risky under sanctions.

## What Comes Next?

The real impact will depend on the continuity of federal licenses, the financial viability of operations, and political stability in Washington and Havana.
