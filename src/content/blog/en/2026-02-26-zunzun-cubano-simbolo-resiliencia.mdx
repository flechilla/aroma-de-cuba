At the heart of the energy crisis currently sweeping the island, a small winged figure continues to capture the imagination of the Cuban people: the **Zunzuncito** (*Mellisuga helenae*). This natural jewel, the smallest bird in the world and endemic to Cuba, is not only a biological miracle measuring a mere 5 centimeters; today it is a mirror reflecting the resilience of the Cuban people themselves.

### A Miniature Giant
Despite its apparent fragility, the Zunzún possesses inexhaustible energy. Capable of flapping its wings up to 80 times per second, this tiny inhabitant of Cuba's fields and gardens shows that size does not define strength. In a 2026 where shortages and blackouts test every household, the Zunzún's tenacity in finding nectar in the most difficult flowers has become a powerful metaphor.

### Symbol of Identity and Hope
The Bee Hummingbird is not only valued by scientists for its crucial role in pollination but is part of the nation's emotional DNA. Just like the bird that never stops moving to survive, Cuban society continues to adapt and find creative solutions in the face of adversity.

> "The Zunzún reminds us that, no matter how small we may feel in the face of problems, constancy is our greatest virtue," say residents who maintain natural bird feeders in their backyards.
