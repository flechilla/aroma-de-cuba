The Cuban government acknowledged it has maintained **"message exchanges"** with the United States, communications that have been linked "to the highest level," though it insists this doesn't constitute formal negotiations.

## Fernández de Cossío Confirms Communications

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs **Carlos Fernández de Cossío**, who has been the official spokesperson on the bilateral crisis, confirmed in an interview with CNN that active communication channels exist.

> "We've had message exchanges, we have embassies, we've had communications, but we can't say we've had a dialogue table."

The diplomat emphasized the difference between routine diplomatic communication and formal negotiations.

## "Linked to the Highest Level"

What's significant about these statements is the acknowledgment that these exchanges have been linked **"to the highest level,"** suggesting communications go beyond regular diplomatic channels between embassies.

This revelation comes as President Donald Trump publicly insists his administration is "negotiating with Cuban leaders," something Havana has repeatedly denied in terms of formal negotiations.

## Cuba Open to Dialogue, But with Conditions

Fernández de Cossío reiterated that Cuba is willing to dialogue with the United States, but established clear conditions:

- **Without coercion** or pressure
- Under terms of **respect and equality**
- Certain topics are **"off the table"**: the Constitution, economy, and socialist system

> "We're open to dialogue. If we can have a dialogue, maybe that can lead to a negotiation."

## Maximum Pressure Context

The statements come at a moment of extreme bilateral tension:

- Cuba hasn't received oil from abroad since December
- Trump signed an executive order threatening tariffs on countries supplying fuel to the island
- Washington has declared the Cuban government is "on the verge of collapse"
- The White House has asked Havana for "prudence" in its statements

The international community is watching closely whether these "message exchanges" can evolve into formal dialogue that alleviates the crisis Cuba faces.
