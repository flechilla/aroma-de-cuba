A devastating accident on Cuba's [National Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopista_Nacional_(Cuba)) on the night of Thursday, February 13, left **four people dead and 16 injured**, two of them critically. The crash occurred near the Zaza bridge in Sancti Spíritus province.

## What Happened

According to the provincial newspaper [Escambray](https://www.escambray.cu/2026/cuatro-fallecidos-y-16-lesionados-en-accidente-masivo-en-la-autopista-nacional-noticia-en-construccion/), the accident involved a **Diana interprovincial bus** traveling from Havana to eastern Cuba. The crash occurred around 11:00 PM and immediately mobilized emergency services across the province.

The four victims, who died at the scene, were identified as:

- **Edilberto Aldana García**, 23, from Vertientes, Camagüey
- **Conrado Peña López**, 58, from Santiago de Cuba
- **Niurka de la Caridad Argelí Ladisté**, 56, from Santiago de Cuba
- **Ualter Chávez Galán**, 30, from Cauto, Granma

## Critical Injuries

Two patients underwent emergency surgery at **Camilo Cienfuegos Provincial General Hospital**. According to Dr. Malena Morera Campos, the hospital's emergency coordinator:

- One patient suffered a **frontal bone fracture**
- The second sustained a **right hemothorax and hepatic laceration**

A **five-year-old child** was among those involved but is hospitalized without serious injuries at the José Martí Pérez Provincial Pediatric Hospital. The remaining patients are reported to be in stable condition.

## A Troubling Pattern

This tragedy adds to a growing list of serious road accidents in Cuba. In early January 2026, another crash in Camagüey province killed two and injured twenty. Cuba's [transport crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-12-crisis-transporte-cuba-bloqueo-petrolero/), worsened by fuel shortages and deteriorating road infrastructure, raises urgent questions about highway safety.

The island's [energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) also affects road lighting and vehicle maintenance — factors that may contribute to rising accident rates. Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the crash.
