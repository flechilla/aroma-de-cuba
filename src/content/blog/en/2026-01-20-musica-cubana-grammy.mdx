Cuban music shines once again on the international stage. At the latest
Latin Grammy ceremony, artists from the island took home awards in five
categories, cementing Cuba's position as an unmatched musical powerhouse.

## A Well-Deserved Recognition

Son, rumba, danzón, and new Cuban fusions proved once more that the
island's musical tradition remains as alive as ever, reinventing itself
without losing its essence.

  Cuban music is a river that never runs dry. Each generation adds a new
  tributary, but the main current has been flowing for centuries.

fusions, demonstrating the versatility and depth of Cuban talent.
