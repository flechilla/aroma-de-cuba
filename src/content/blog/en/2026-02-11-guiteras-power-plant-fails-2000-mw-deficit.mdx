faq:
  - question: "Why is the Guiteras power plant so important for Cuba?"
    answer: "The Antonio Guiteras plant in Matanzas is Cuba's most powerful single unit, with a capacity of 317 MW. When it fails, the impact on the national power supply is immediate and severe, affecting the entire island."
  - question: "What caused the Guiteras to go offline this time?"
    answer: "The plant was taken out of service due to a crack detected in the boiler structure. It had been operational for only five days since its last repair."
  - question: "How many hours of blackouts can Cubans expect?"
    answer: "With a deficit approaching 2,000 MW, many provinces are experiencing 12 to 16 hours without electricity daily. Rural areas may face even longer outages."
  - question: "When might the Guiteras be repaired?"
    answer: "No official timeline has been announced. Boiler damage typically requires days or weeks to repair, depending on the availability of parts and specialized personnel."

Monday night, February 10th, brought grim news for Cubans: the **Antonio Guiteras** thermoelectric plant, the country's most powerful single generating unit, went offline again due to a **crack in the boiler structure**.

## Only Five Days in Operation

The Guiteras plant, located in Matanzas province, had returned to service just five days earlier following its previous breakdown. This new failure represents a devastating blow to an electrical system already crippled by Cuba's ongoing fuel crisis.

With this 317 MW unit offline, **Cuba's Electric Union** projected that the energy deficit would approach **2,000 megawatts** Monday night, triggering massive blackouts across virtually every province.

## A Plant with a Troubled History

The Antonio Guiteras plant, built in the 1980s with Soviet technology, has been a constant source of problems in recent years. Its frequent failures stem from:

- **Age** of the infrastructure (over 40 years old)
- **Lack of preventive maintenance** due to resource shortages
- **Scarcity of spare parts** because of the embargo and economic crisis
- **Operational overload** amid growing demand

## Impact on Daily Life

For millions of Cubans, the news means more hours without electricity in homes, hospitals, schools, and workplaces. Blackouts, ironically called "alumbrones" (big lights) by locals, have become the norm:

- Refrigerators not working, leading to food spoilage
- Medical equipment dependent on emergency generators
- Public transportation paralyzed by fuel shortages
- Economic activity reduced to a minimum

## The Crisis Context

This breakdown occurs amid the worst energy crisis Cuba has faced in decades. U.S. sanctions have effectively cut off oil supplies from Venezuela and Mexico, forcing the government to implement **emergency measures** including:

- University and school closures
- Four-day work weeks
- Suspension of non-urgent surgeries
- Fuel rationing for transportation

Authorities have not announced when the Guiteras might be repaired or how they will compensate for its absence from the grid. Meanwhile, Cubans continue adapting to a reality where electricity has become a scarce commodity.
