# Guayabita del Pinar: The Liqueur That Defines Vueltabajo

In Cuba's westernmost province, where the world's finest tobacco grows, there exists another liquid treasure that can't be classified as rum, whiskey, or any other known spirit. **Guayabita del Pinar** is simply that: the flavorful liqueur of Vueltabajo, unique on the planet.

## A Wild Fruit, A Legendary Liqueur

The guayabita (*Psidium salutare*) is a tiny fruit—about the size of a blueberry—that grows wild beneath the pine forests of [Pinar del Río](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo). It's a distant cousin of the common guava, but its aroma and flavor are unmistakably unique: more intense, more perfumed, with notes reminiscent of the pine forest where it ripens.

This shrub, endemic to western Cuba, grows in sandy, undulating soils, and its small green fruits have been used for centuries to create a beverage that now holds **Protected Designation of Origin**.

## History: From Tobacco Farmers to Casa Garay

### Tobacco Grower Origins

In the early 19th century, tobacco farmers (*vegueros*) in Pinar del Río discovered that infusing guayabitas in sugarcane brandy created a delicious drink. It became tradition among tobacco cultivators to prepare this homemade elixir to beat the heat and celebrate harvests.

### The Asturian Visionary

Spanish immigrant **Genaro Rivera** was the first to see commercial potential, selling his version from a kiosk. But it was **Lucio Garay Zavala**, another Asturian, who transformed the artisanal drink into an industry when in **1892** he established precise proportions, patented the formula, and founded what we now know as **[Casa Garay](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1brica_de_bebidas_Casa_Garay)**.

The Casa Garay factory, located in the heart of Pinar del Río city, remains the **only one authorized** to produce Guayabita del Pinar with Designation of Origin.

## Artisanal Production

### Ingredients

- **Wild guayabita** (hand-harvested in the pine forests)
- Cuban **sugarcane brandy**
- **Sugar** (more or less depending on version)
- Local **spring water**

### The Process

1. **Maceration**: Guayabitas are soaked in brandy for weeks, extracting their essence
2. **Resting**: The macerate rests to allow flavors to integrate
3. **Aging**: It ages in oak barrels, developing its characteristic amber color
4. **Filtering and bottling**: Many bottles include one or two floating guayabitas as a symbol of authenticity

The entire process remains **largely manual**, preserving the century-old tradition.

## Two Versions, One Pleasure

### Dry Guayabita (Seca)

- Darker amber color
- Intense, fruity flavor
- Less sweet, more pronounced
- Ideal as a **digestif** after meals
- Label with white background and pink stripe

### Sweet Guayabita (Dulce)

- Lighter amber color
- Aromatic and smooth
- More sweetness, more accessible
- Perfect **chilled or in cocktails**
- Label with yellow background

## How to Enjoy It

### Neat
The traditional way: at room temperature or slightly chilled, in a small glass. Let the aroma envelop you before the first sip.

### In a Cocktail
Mix sweet Guayabita with ice, a touch of lime, and sparkling water for a refreshing drink.

### Pairing
Accompany with aged cheeses, guava desserts, or simply a fine Vueltabajo cigar—the perfect pairing of Pinar's two treasures.

## Heritage at Risk

According to recent reports from [OnCubaNews](https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/guayabita-del-pinar-heritage-in-danger-of-extinction/), Guayabita del Pinar faces challenges. The wild plant has declined in recent decades, and artisanal production struggles against resource shortages. It's more urgent than ever to support and preserve this liquid Cuban heritage.

## Visiting the Casa Garay Factory

If you travel to Cuba, the **Guayabita del Pinar Liqueur Factory** is a must-stop. The visit includes:

- Tour of the historic facilities
- Explanation of the production process
- **Tasting** of both versions
- Shop to purchase bottles

Address: Calle Isabel Rubio No. 189, Pinar del Río, Cuba.

## A Liqueur Without Classification

Guayabita del Pinar is not rum, not whiskey, not simple aguardiente. It's **the flavorful liqueur of Vueltabajo**: a category of its own, a unique taste, a piece of Pinar del Río bottled.

Like the tobacco that grows in the same red soil, like the coffee from nearby mountains, Guayabita represents the best of western Cuba: tradition, craftsmanship, and a flavor that exists nowhere else in the world.
