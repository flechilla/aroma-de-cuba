faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between tostones and maduros?"
    answer: "Tostones are made from green plantains and fried twice for a crispy texture. Maduros use ripe yellow plantains, are sweet, and only fried once."
  - question: "Why do my tostones come out hard inside?"
    answer: "The most common mistake is cutting slices too thick. They should be 2-3 cm thick before smashing. Also ensure your oil is hot enough (180°C/350°F)."
  - question: "Can you make tostones in an air fryer?"
    answer: "Yes, spray slices with oil and cook at 400°F for 10 minutes, smash, then cook 5 more minutes. They're less crispy but healthier."
  - question: "What do Cubans serve with tostones?"
    answer: "Traditionally mojo criollo sauce, but they accompany lechón (roast pork), ropa vieja, vaca frita, seafood, and almost any Cuban dish. They're the universal side."

There are sounds that define a kitchen. In Cuba, one of them is the **sizzle of green plantain** plunging into hot oil. **Tostones** —those golden discs, crispy outside and tender within— are much more than a side dish: they're a declaration of culinary identity.

## What Are Tostones?

Tostones (also called *patacones* in other Caribbean and Central American countries) are slices of **green plantain** that are fried twice. The first frying cooks them; the second —after smashing— makes them crispy. This double-cooking method gives them their characteristic texture: **crunchy exterior, creamy interior**.

Unlike [maduros](/en/blog/sweet-fried-plantains/) (fried ripe plantains that are sweet), tostones are savory and neutral, perfect for absorbing sauces like [mojo criollo](/en/blog/2026-02-11-yuca-con-mojo/).

## History: From Africa to the Caribbean

The plantain arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, brought by the Spanish from the Canary Islands. But the technique of frying and smashing green plantains has African roots, introduced to the Caribbean by enslaved people who adapted their culinary traditions to available ingredients.

In Cuba, tostones became an essential part of the *criollo* table. According to culinary historian [Ciro Bianchi Ross](https://www.ecured.cu/Ciro_Bianchi_Ross), by the 19th century they appeared in Havana's *fondas* (taverns) as a mandatory accompaniment to roast pork and black beans.

## The Perfect Technique: Step by Step

### Ingredients
- 2 green plantains (very green, no yellow spots)
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt to taste
- [Mojo criollo](/en/blog/2026-02-11-yuca-con-mojo/) for serving

### Preparation

**1. Peel the plantains**
This is the hardest step. Green plantains don't peel like ripe ones. Make a lengthwise cut through the skin without reaching the flesh, then slide your finger or a spoon under the peel to separate it.

**2. Cut into rounds**
Slice the plantain into rounds about **1 inch thick**. Not too thin (they'll dry out) or too thick (raw inside).

**3. First fry**
Heat oil to 325°F (160-170°C). Fry the rounds for **3-4 minutes** until lightly golden. They shouldn't be crispy yet.

**4. Smash**
Remove the rounds and smash them immediately with a *tostonera* (wooden press) or the bottom of a glass. They should be about **half an inch thick**.

**5. Second fry**
Raise the oil to **350-375°F (180-190°C)**. Fry the smashed tostones for **2-3 minutes** until golden and crispy.

**6. Drain and salt**
Place on paper towels and salt immediately while still hot.

## Cuban Grandma's Secrets

- **The garlic water**: Some cooks dip the smashed rounds in garlic-salted water before the second fry. This adds flavor and helps achieve extra crispiness.
- **The right oil**: Traditionally lard was used, which provides unmatched flavor. Today, corn or canola oil works well.
- **Serve immediately**: Tostones don't wait. Eat them straight from the oil.

## What Do You Eat Them With?

In Cuba, tostones appear alongside:

- **[Ropa vieja](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ropa-vieja-cuban-national-dish-recipe-history/)** — the classic duo
- **Lechón asado** — especially on Christmas Eve
- **[Moros y cristianos](/en/blog/2026-02-11-moros-y-cristianos/)** — the perfect combination
- **Vaca frita** — crispy with crispy
- **Seafood** — at coastal restaurants

They can also be served as *stuffed tostones*, a popular Miami innovation where they're topped with [shredded ropa vieja](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/stuffed-tostones-recipe-2043102), garlic shrimp, or ceviche.

## Regional Variations

| Region | Name | Particularity |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Cuba | Tostones | Classic with mojo |
| Puerto Rico | Tostones | With mayo-ketchup |
| Colombia | Patacones | Larger, with hogao |
| Dominican Republic | Tostones | With fried salami |

## Tostones in the Diaspora

In Miami, tostones have evolved. Restaurants like [Versailles](https://www.versaillesrestaurant.com/) on Calle Ocho serve them as part of their *Cuban combo*, while contemporary chefs reinvent them with truffle, brie cheese, or avocado.

But ask any Cuban: the best tostones are homemade ones, made with plantains from the neighborhood market and served hot on a newspaper-lined plate.

*Tostones are proof that sometimes the simplest things are the most perfect. Two ingredients, two fries, infinite memories.*
