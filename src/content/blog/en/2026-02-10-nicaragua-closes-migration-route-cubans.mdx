In another blow to Cubans seeking to emigrate, **Nicaragua has eliminated visa-free entry for Cuban citizens**, closing one of the most-used migration routes to the United States.

## The Nicaragua Route

Since Nicaragua eliminated the visa requirement for Cubans in 2021, the Central American country became **the main exit door** for thousands of Cubans. The route was clear:

1. Fly from Havana to Managua (no visa required)
2. Travel overland through Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico
3. Reach the southern US border

According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/americas/nicaragua-cuba-us-immigration.html), long lines formed Monday outside the Nicaraguan embassy in Havana, with desperate Cubans seeking information.

## Why Now?

The closure coincides with intensified US pressure on Cuba. The Trump administration has made clear its goal of forcing changes on the island, and Nicaragua — a traditional Havana ally — appears to be yielding to the pressure.

## Impact on Cuban Migration

This decision directly affects thousands of Cubans planning to emigrate:

- **No viable air route:** With international flights suspended due to fuel shortages and now Nicaragua closed, legal options are drastically reduced
- **Greater risk:** Those who still try to emigrate will have to seek more dangerous and expensive routes
- **Separated families:** Many who hoped to reunite with relatives in the US see their plans cut short

## An Ever-Tightening Siege

This news adds to a devastating week for Cuba:

- [Lack of aviation fuel](/blog/en/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights) paralyzes international flights
- [Extreme rationing](/blog/en/2026-02-10-cubans-survive-fuel-rationing-special-period) recalls the Special Period
- Canadian airlines (Air Canada, Air Transat, WestJet) suspend operations
- And now, the most accessible migration route closes

## The Diaspora on Edge

For the millions of Cubans abroad with family on the island, the situation is distressing. Options for their loved ones to leave are shrinking by the day.
