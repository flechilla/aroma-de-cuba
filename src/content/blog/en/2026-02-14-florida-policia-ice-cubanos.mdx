The state of Florida reimbursed over **$1.7 million** to law enforcement agencies in Volusia and Flagler counties for their collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to [The Observer](https://www.observerlocalnews.com/news/2026/feb/12/volusia-flagler-law-enforcement-agencies-reimbursed-by-florida-for-supporting-ice-operations/).

During a press conference in Daytona Beach, Florida's Chief Financial Officer **Blaise Ingoglia** defended the measures as part of a strategy to "create deterrence" and curb irregular immigration in the state.

## Where Did the Funds Go?

The largest allocation went to the **Flagler County Sheriff's Office**, which received over **$725,000**. The funds were used for:

- **Training** agents to support ICE operations
- **Rapid identification technology** linked to federal databases
- **Stipends** for officers participating in immigration operations

Sheriff Rick Staly left no room for ambiguity: *"If you come to Flagler County, commit a crime, you should expect to be arrested, and if you are here illegally, we will hand you over to ICE."*

## Cuban Cases Highlighted

During the conference, Staly spotlighted specific cases involving Cuban citizens:

- A Cuban man **sentenced in 2025 for sexual assault against a minor**, receiving a six-year prison sentence with deportation scheduled after serving his time
- Another Cuban [arrested for stealing nearly $4,000 worth of meat from a Publix supermarket](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-01-31-u1-e208933-s27061-nid319776-cubano-termina-arrestado-florida-tras-robar-casi)

Since February 2025, the Volusia Sheriff's Office has recorded approximately **220 encounters** with individuals referred to ICE or Border Patrol for immigration detentions.

## New Legislative Proposals

Ingoglia also announced initiatives to further tighten Florida's immigration landscape:

1. **Ban commercial driver's licenses** for individuals without legal status
2. **Suspend exams in languages other than English**
3. **Expand the HALO law** to make it a misdemeanor to film federal agents from less than 25 feet away

## Impact on the Cuban Community

Florida is home to one of the **largest Cuban communities** in the United States. Many Cubans have pending asylum cases, [expired paroles or I-220A supervision orders](/en/blog/2026-02-11-formularios-i220-cubanos-guia/), or unresolved proceedings.

While authorities insist the actions target those who commit crimes, the reality is that police-ICE collaboration operations create a climate of fear that affects the entire community, regardless of immigration status.

This news adds to the [recent wave of ICE arrests of Cubans](/en/blog/2026-02-12-ice-arresta-cinco-cubanos-antecedentes-penales/) and the [debate over deportations to third countries](/en/blog/2026-02-14-deportaciones-terceros-paises-40-millones/) that has marked the first weeks of 2026.
