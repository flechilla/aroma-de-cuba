The Cuban Ministry of the Interior (Minint) reported this Friday a major armed incident in Cuban territorial waters, specifically near **Cayo Falcones**, in the municipality of Corralillo, Villa Clara. According to the official version, border guard troops intercepted a speedboat with Florida (USA) registration, resulting in a fatal confrontation that left **four people dead**.

## Details of the Incident According to Minint

According to the statement released by the island's authorities, the vessel was identified with registration number **FL7726SH**. The report claims that 10 armed people were on board who, according to preliminary statements from the detained survivors, intended to carry out an "infiltration for terrorist purposes."

The confrontation occurred when the Cuban patrol attempted to identify the boat. Cuban authorities maintain that firearms and ammunition were recovered at the scene.
