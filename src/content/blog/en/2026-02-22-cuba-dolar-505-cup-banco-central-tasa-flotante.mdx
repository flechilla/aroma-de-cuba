faq:
  - question: "Why did the dollar reach 505 CUP in Cuba?"
    answer: "A perfect storm of energy crisis, reduced remittances, foreign currency shortages, and collapsing confidence in the Cuban peso drove the informal rate to that record. The widening gap between official and market rates reflects deep monetary policy failure."
  - question: "What is Cuba's Central Bank 'floating rate'?"
    answer: "It is an official exchange rate that the Central Bank adjusts periodically to track the informal market. On February 21, 2026, it was raised from 458 to 463 CUP per dollar — but the street market was already at 505 CUP, leaving a 42-peso gap."
  - question: "How does this affect Cuban families?"
    answer: "A family receiving $100 in remittances can now exchange it for 50,500 CUP on the street versus 46,300 at the bank. The real problem is the scarcity of dollars and the rising prices that accompany devaluation."
  - question: "How high could the informal dollar rate go in Cuba?"
    answer: "Economists do not rule out the dollar exceeding 600 CUP if the energy crisis and oil blockade continue unresolved. The real parity depends on how much fuel and remittances reach the island in coming months."

On **February 20, 2026**, Cuba's informal dollar crossed the **500 Cuban peso (CUP)** barrier for the first time, closing at **505 CUP**. The very next day, Cuba's Central Bank responded with its customary slow step: it raised the official "floating rate" from 458 to **463 CUP**. The gap between the two: **42 pesos**. That distance tells you everything about the state of Cuba's economy.

## A Record Nobody's Celebrating

The euro followed suit, touching **560 CUP** in the informal market — another historic high. For a Cuban family dependent on remittances, these aren't statistics: they're the price of milk, of transportation, of surviving another month.

The psychological 500-peso barrier had [already been breached earlier this month](/blog/en/2026-02-10-dolar-rompe-barrera-500-pesos-cubanos/), but it has now consolidated as a new floor, not a temporary ceiling.

## A Floating Rate That Doesn't Float

Cuba's Central Bank has been using the "floating rate" as a shield for months: an exchange rate adjusted upward whenever the informal market drifts too far. The problem is that this rate remains **voluntary and restricted** — available only through certain banking channels — while the street market operates without limits.

The result is a system that punishes those who use state banking and rewards those who exchange on the street, perpetuating the very informal market it claims to eliminate.

Meanwhile, [Mariel Port now charges U.S. dollars](/blog/en/2026-02-22-terminal-mariel-cobrara-usd-importaciones-privadas/) to private SMEs for imports, and [Cuba is eliminating ration system subsidies in April](/blog/en/2026-02-19-cuba-canasta-normada-sin-subsidios-abril/) — two signals that dollarization is advancing without a coherent monetary framework.

## The Context That Explains Everything

Cuba's economy [contracted 5% in 2025](/blog/en/2026-02-10-economia-cuba-se-contrajo-cinco-porciento-2025/) according to government-linked data. The collapse of tourism, the power grid crisis, and the reduction of medical service exports have drained the state's foreign currency reserves.

In this context, every dollar entering the country becomes an extremely scarce good. Private businesses need hard currency to import; families need it to buy medicines or shop in MLC stores. And the state is competing with both in the very market it claims to regulate.

Negotiations between Washington and Havana — [confirmed by Trump himself](/blog/en/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo/) — could ease the pressure if they result in remittance access and relief from the oil blockade. But until then, the informal dollar follows its own relentless logic.

## What Economists Are Saying

Analysts at elTOQUE, which monitors the informal rate in real time, note that the gap between the official and informal rate is the most honest thermometer of the crisis of confidence. When the state sets a rate that nobody uses, it isn't controlling the market — it's admitting it no longer can.

The question is not whether the dollar will keep rising. The question is how long Cubans' purchasing power can hold before that pressure finds another outlet.
