Cuba's Minister of Finance and Prices, Vladimir Regueiro Ale, assured on Monday during the television program Mesa Redonda that the government has guaranteed pension payments in the budget, amid an economic crisis particularly affecting the elderly.

## "It's a Priority"

According to the official on the [government program](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=1941568796710921), 66% of planned expenses for this year focus on the social area, prioritizing sectors such as health, education, assistance, and social security.

"Every month our pensioners will have those pensions guaranteed," Regueiro Ale insisted.

The minister indicated that the partial pension increase represents more than 20 billion pesos projected for 2026, funds backed by the state budget.

## An Increase That "Doesn't Fully Solve"

In a rare acknowledgment, the minister admitted that the pension system faces "a significant challenge" and that the partial increase for retirees "doesn't provide a complete solution" to the low incomes they receive.

This statement contrasts with the reality lived by thousands of Cuban retirees, who survive on incomes that don't even cover basic necessities, in a country marked by inflation, food and medicine shortages, and loss of purchasing power.

## Context: Deep Crisis

The statements come at a time when Cuba faces one of its worst economic crises:

- [Emergency measures including university closures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals)

For many retirees, the question remains the same: does that money really suffice to live on?
