Before Cuba was Cuba — before the son, the coffee, and the revolutions — there were seven towns. Seven villas founded by a Spanish conquistador who crossed the island from end to end, planting crosses and raising churches between 1511 and 1515.

Those seven villas didn't just mark the birth of a colony. They were the seeds of a nation.

## Diego Velázquez: the man behind the conquest

[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar) was no newcomer when he arrived in Cuba. A veteran of the colonization of Hispaniola alongside Columbus, he had accumulated enough experience — and ambition — to lead the conquest of the Caribbean's largest island.

In 1511, he departed from Salvatierra de la Sabana (in present-day Haiti) with some 300 men. His mission: to subdue the indigenous peoples and establish permanent settlements to serve as administrative, religious, and economic centers for the Spanish Crown.

What followed was a four-year journey that would forever reshape Cuba's human geography.

## The seven villas, one by one

### 1. Baracoa (1511) — The first city

**Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa** was the first villa and first capital of Cuba. Nestled in the far east between mountains and sea, Baracoa retains a singular character to this day. Its parish church houses the [Cruz de Parra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Parra), believed to be the only surviving cross of the 29 planted by Columbus in the Americas.

Indigenous resistance, led by the cacique [Hatuey](/en/blog/hatuey-primer-heroe-nacional-cuba/), was crushed here with brutal violence. Hatuey was burned at the stake in 1512, becoming Cuba's first symbol of resistance.

### 2. Bayamo (1513) — Cradle of nationality

**San Salvador de Bayamo**, founded on November 5, 1513, would centuries later become the cradle of Cuban independence. Here the [National Anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Himno_de_Bayamo) was first sung in 1868, and here [Carlos Manuel de Céspedes](/en/blog/grito-de-yara-cespedes-1868/) launched the first cry for freedom.

The people of Bayamo, rather than surrender their city to the enemy, chose to burn it entirely in January 1869 — an act of defiance that still defines the city's character.

### 3. Trinidad (1514) — The colonial jewel

**La Santísima Trinidad**, founded in 1514, is today Cuba's best-preserved colonial town and a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/460/) since 1988. Its cobblestone streets, red-tiled roofs, and plazas surrounded by 19th-century mansions make it a living museum.

Trinidad prospered through the sugar industry and trade (smuggling included). The nearby Valley of the Sugar Mills stands as testament to that wealth — and to the slavery that made it possible.

### 4. Sancti Spíritus (1514) — The city on the Yayabo

**Sancti Spíritus** was founded in 1514, though it relocated in 1522 to the banks of the Yayabo River for better conditions. It's famous for its [bridge over the Yayabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayabo_Bridge), the only one of its kind surviving in Cuba, and for a legend: the guayabera shirt supposedly originated here, named for the guavas (*guayabas*) carried in its pockets.

### 5. Puerto Príncipe (1514) — Today's Camagüey

**Santa María del Puerto del Príncipe**, now [Camagüey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey), was founded in 1514 on the northern coast before moving inland. Its irregular maze of streets — designed, tradition holds, to confuse pirates — earned it World Heritage status in 2008.

Camagüey is also the city of *tinajones*, enormous clay jars once used to collect rainwater, now its most recognizable symbol.

### 6. Santiago de Cuba (1515) — The rebel capital

**Santiago de Cuba**, founded in 1515 likely under the oversight of Hernán Cortés (then its mayor), served as Cuba's capital until 1589. Hero city, Caribbean capital, birthplace of son music and revolutions.

The [Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/841/), a World Heritage Site, is the most complete example of Spanish-American military architecture from the 17th-18th centuries.

### 7. San Cristóbal de La Habana (1515) — Key to the New World

The last villa founded was **San Cristóbal de La Habana** in 1515, initially on the southern coast before settling at its current location beside the bay. Its strategic position made it the most important port of the Spanish empire in the Americas — the "Key to the New World," as its coat of arms proclaims.

[Old Havana](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/204/) was declared a World Heritage Site in 1982.

## The human cost

The founding of the seven villas was no peaceful enterprise. Cuba's Taíno and Siboney populations were decimated by direct violence, forced labor through the *encomienda* system, and diseases brought by Europeans. Within mere decades, the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared as a distinct demographic group.

The [encomienda system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda) distributed indigenous people among settlers as forced labor. When the indigenous population dwindled, the Spanish turned to the [African slave trade](/en/blog/cimarrones-palenques-resistencia-esclavitud-cuba/) — opening another chapter of exploitation that would last centuries.

## A legacy that endures

Five hundred years later, the seven original villas remain living cities. Four of them — Trinidad, Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and Camagüey — are World Heritage Sites. Baracoa keeps its magical isolation. Bayamo remains proud of its rebellion. Sancti Spíritus preserves its bridge and legends.

They are Cuba's roots. Everything that followed — slavery, sugar, the wars of independence, the republic, the revolution — grew from the foundations Diego Velázquez planted between 1511 and 1515, never imagining the nation that would rise from those seven small villas.
