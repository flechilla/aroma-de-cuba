Today, February 12, 2026, the gates of the **Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña** were supposed to swing open for thousands of readers, writers, and publishers from around the world. The **34th Havana International Book Fair** was ready: the booths, the catalogs, the readings. But the gates stayed shut.

On February 7, Culture Minister **Alpidio Alonso** announced on national television what many feared: **the Book Fair is postponed** indefinitely.

## An Unprecedented Decision

The Havana Book Fair is, without exaggeration, **Cuba's most important cultural event**. It's not just a publishing exhibition — it's a carnival of the written word, a massive gathering that transforms La Cabaña into a city within a city for ten days, with poetry readings, children's activities, art exhibitions, and evening concerts.

> "An event as large as the Book Fair, which is the largest cultural event that attracts so many people, especially at La Cabaña Fortress, has led us to postpone it," Alonso stated.

The official reason: the **fuel crisis** gripping Cuba after the tightening of US sanctions. Without reliable transportation, stable electricity, or the minimum logistics required for an event of this scale, the decision was unavoidable.

The [Cuban Book Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Book_Institute) (ICL) confirmed that book production will continue, prioritizing digital formats, and that a new date will be announced "in due course."

## More Than Four Decades of History

To understand what's being lost — temporarily, we hope — you need to know what the Fair represents.

### Origins (1937-1982)

Efforts to organize a book fair in Havana date back to **May 1937**, when the first state-backed exhibition was held at La Punta esplanade, the Malecón, and Paseo de Martí. It was a modest event, but it set a precedent.

After the Revolution triumphed in 1959, the [National Literacy Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_literacy_campaign) of 1961 transformed Cuba into one of the world's most literate nations. Books went from luxury to birthright.

The **first International Book Fair** was held in **1982** at the National Museum of Fine Arts. Dedicated to three authors, it featured a small representation of Latin American publishers. For its first years, it was a biennial event.

### The La Cabaña Era (2000-Present)

In **2000**, the Fair moved to the **Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña**, built between 1763 and 1774 by the Spanish after the British captured Havana. This venue change was transformative: the fortress, with its stone walls and open courtyards, gave the Fair a monumental scale.

From that year on, the event became **annual** and adopted the slogan *"To Read is to Grow."* Each edition is dedicated to a Cuban writer and a guest country of honor:

- **2000**: Dedicated to [Cintio Vitier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cintio_Vitier), guest country Italy
- **2017**: Canada as guest of honor
- **2022**: 30th edition, with Mexico as guest country
- **2024**: Last edition held before the 2026 postponement

Over **100 publishers** regularly participate, including the iconic [Casa de las Américas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_de_las_Am%C3%A9ricas). At its peak, the Fair has drawn **more than 600,000 visitors** in Havana alone, before traveling to every province and closing in Santiago de Cuba.

## Culture as Resistance

The Fair's postponement isn't just a logistics issue — it's a **symptom of Cuba's deepest crisis** in decades. When fuel doesn't reach public transport, when hospitals run on generators and universities suspend classes, a massive cultural event becomes impossible.

But there's something the crisis cannot postpone: **Cuba's relationship with books**.

Cuba maintains one of the world's highest literacy rates (99.8% according to [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)). The island's literary tradition has produced giants like [Alejo Carpentier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejo_Carpentier), [José Lezama Lima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Lezama_Lima), [Nicolás Guillén](/en/blog/2026-02-12-nicolas-guillen-poeta-nacional-cuba/), and [Dulce María Loynaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_Mar%C3%ADa_Loynaz). For a people who learned to read as a revolutionary act, books aren't entertainment — they're identity.

As the ICL declared: book production **continues**. The titles scheduled for the Fair will still be published. The written word, like the island itself, finds a way to survive.

## What to Expect

There's no confirmed date for the rescheduled edition. The ICL has promised to announce it "in due course," which in Cuban practice could mean weeks or months.

What we do know:
- **Book production continues**, with emphasis on digital formats
- **Scheduled titles will be published** as planned
- **The Fair will return** — the question is when, not if

Meanwhile, La Cabaña waits. Its stone walls have witnessed centuries of history — from Spanish cannons to Lezama Lima's verses. They can wait a little longer.

*The Havana International Book Fair was supposed to open today. Instead, we leave these words as a reminder that Cuban culture isn't postponed — it just changes format.*
