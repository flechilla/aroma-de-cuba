When blackouts last up to 12 hours, when daily life becomes survival, when the world seems to forget you — **jazz keeps playing in Havana**.

From January 25 to February 1, 2026, the **International Jazz Plaza Festival** celebrated its 41st edition, proving that Cuban music is more resilient than any crisis.

## Over 1,500 Artists, 20 Countries

This edition broke records: **286 international artists** from Spain, the United States, Mexico, France, Austria, Russia, Brazil, Italy, China, and more than a dozen other countries joined hundreds of Cuban musicians.

For the first time in the festival's history, Jazz Plaza expanded simultaneously to **four cities**: Havana, Santa Clara, Santiago de Cuba, and newcomer Holguín.

> "Every year the festival takes place under very complex conditions, but I think they have never been as complex as they are now." — Víctor Rodríguez, organizing committee president

## From Montreux to Havana

One of the most anticipated concerts brought together **Cuban winners of the Montreux Jazz Festival** (Switzerland):

- **Harold López-Nussa** — piano
- **Rolando Luna** — piano
- **Jorge Luis Pacheco** — piano
- **Yilian Cañizares** — violin and voice
- **Héctor Quintana** — guitar

A demonstration that Cuban talent continues conquering the world's most demanding stages.

## Nachito Herrera and the National Symphony

Pianist **Ignacio "Nachito" Herrera**, now based in the United States, rehearsed for weeks with the **Havana National Symphony Orchestra** under Igor Corcuera's direction to deliver a memorable performance.

Other notable artists included American pianists **Aaron Goldberg, Edward Simon, and Christian Sands**, alongside Cuban diaspora figures like **Dayramir González**.

## The Theme: "La Rumba me llama"

Composer **Roberto Fonseca**, the festival's artistic director, created this edition's musical theme. Visual identity was handled by master artist **Alfredo Sosabravo**, National Plastic Arts Prize winner in 1997.

## Jazz Against the Blackouts

Musicians rehearsed at **Abdala Studios** in Miramar, one of Cuba's best-equipped facilities. But even there, they faced daily power outages. Sponsor **Tulip Power** installed generators to keep rehearsals running.

During the week before the festival, some Havana neighborhoods suffered blackouts lasting up to 12 hours. One musician confessed between rehearsals: *"I haven't been able to pump water for five days. All I eat is spaghetti and pizza. I can't take it anymore."*

Yet when they stepped on stage, everything disappeared. Only the music remained.

## 41 Years of History

Jazz Plaza was born in 1980 and became international in 1983. Giants who have graced its stages include:

- **Dizzy Gillespie** — the trumpeter who revolutionized bebop
- **Max Roach** — drumming legend
- **Roy Hargrove** — bridge between generations
- **Michel Legrand** — the French composer
- **Chucho Valdés** — Cuban jazz's prodigal son
- **Arturo O'Farrill** — heir to Chico O'Farrill

## Cuba: A Country of Music

Ernán López-Nussa, a foundational figure in Cuban jazz, remembers when listening to jazz or rock was considered "enemy music" by authorities. Today, jazz is a cultural symbol of Cuba.

"Cuba is a country of music," López-Nussa says. And Jazz Plaza proves it every January.

## Looking Ahead

Despite travel restrictions, economic crisis, and political threats, Jazz Plaza persists. It's more than a festival: it's a statement that **Cuban culture will not be silenced**.

*When everything fails, jazz remains. And in Cuba, jazz never fails.*
