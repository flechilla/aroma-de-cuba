faq:
  - question: "What are viandas in Cuban cooking?"
    answer: "In Cuba, 'viandas' refers to starchy root vegetables and tubers that form the base of most meals: cassava (yuca), malanga (taro), boniato (Cuban sweet potato), yam (ñame), plantain, squash, and potato. They've been central to Cuban cuisine since pre-Columbian times."
  - question: "What is the difference between malanga and yam?"
    answer: "Malanga (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) is smaller with creamy white or purple flesh and a delicate, nutty flavor. Yam (Dioscorea) is much larger, with white fibrous flesh and a more neutral taste. Both are boiled, but malanga is preferred for purees and fritters."
  - question: "Where can I buy Cuban root vegetables in the US?"
    answer: "Find them at Latin supermarkets like Sedano's, Bravo, and Presidente in Florida, or in the tropical produce section of Walmart and Publix. Online options include Amazon Fresh and specialty Caribbean grocery stores."
  - question: "Why are viandas so important in Cuban cuisine?"
    answer: "Viandas provide essential carbohydrates, fiber, and minerals. They are a direct heritage from the Taíno people (cassava, sweet potato) and African traditions (yam, malanga). During the Special Period of the 1990s, they literally prevented mass starvation."

At any self-respecting Cuban table, viandas hold a sacred place. They're not a side dish — they're **the foundation** of Creole cooking. Before the rice, before the sofrito, before everything else, there are the tubers that fed the Taíno and continue to feed Cuba today.

The word "vianda" has a specific meaning on the island. While in Spain it refers to any food, in Cuba it designates the **roots, tubers, and starchy fruits** that are boiled, fried, or mashed: [cassava](/en/blog/2026-02-11-yuca-con-mojo-cubano/), malanga, boniato, yam, plantain, squash, and potato.

## Cassava (Yuca): Taíno Heritage

[Cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava) (*Manihot esculenta*) is the queen of Cuban viandas and the island's oldest tuber. The Taíno cultivated it long before the Spanish arrived, using it to make **casabe**, a flatbread still consumed in eastern Cuba today.

Boiled cassava with [mojo criollo](/en/blog/2026-02-11-mojo-criollo-salsa-cubana/) is perhaps Cuba's most iconic vianda dish. It's also used to make:

- **Cuban buñuelos**: Figure-eight fritters soaked in anise syrup
- **Casabe**: Crunchy gluten-free flatbread, a pre-Columbian tradition
- **Fried yuca**: Cuba's answer to French fries

> **Fun fact**: Cuba produces around 500,000 tons of cassava annually according to the [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/), making it the country's most important root crop.

## Malanga: Creamy and Comforting

[Malanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthosoma) (*Xanthosoma sagittifolium*), related to taro, is the tuber every Cuban grandmother recommends when someone is sick. Its soft, nutritious puree is often the first solid food Cuban babies taste.

Two main varieties grow in Cuba:

- **White malanga** (*isleña*): The most common, with creamy white flesh
- **Purple malanga** (*morada*): Purple-tinged flesh, sweeter and more aromatic

Malanga is boiled and served with mojo, mashed into puree, or sliced thin to make **mariquitas de malanga** — crispy chips that rival plantain chips.

## Boniato: Sweetness from the Earth

[Boniato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato) (*Ipomoea batatas*) is the Cuban sweet potato, but don't confuse it with the American variety. Cuban boniato has **red or pink skin with white flesh**, a drier texture, and a subtle sweetness that sets it apart.

Cubans prepare it in multiple ways:

- **Boiled**: With a drizzle of mojo or butter
- **Fried in rounds**: Golden and crispy on the outside
- **Boniatillo**: Traditional dessert made with grated boniato, sugar, cinnamon, and dry wine
- **In ajiaco**: An essential ingredient in Cuba's [ajiaco](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ajiaco-cubano/), the national stew

## Ñame (Tropical Yam): The African Giant

[Yam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(vegetable)) (*Dioscorea spp.*) arrived in Cuba with enslaved Africans and adapted perfectly to the tropical climate. It's the largest of all Cuban tubers — a single yam can weigh **over 40 pounds**.

Its flavor is more neutral than malanga, and its texture more fibrous. In Cuba it's used mainly:

- Boiled in large chunks, dressed with mojo
- In soups and stews as a natural thickener
- Grated for fritters

Yam holds special importance in [Cuban Santería](/en/blog/2026-02-12-santeria-cubana-religion-orishas/), where it's offered to various orishas, particularly Oggún and Changó.

## Plantain: Green, Ripening, and Ripe

Though technically a fruit, the [plantain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_banana) functions as a vianda in Cuban cooking. It's eaten at three stages of ripeness, each with its own culinary personality:

| Stage | Color | Texture | Preparation |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Green** | Dark green | Firm, starchy | [Tostones](/en/blog/2026-02-11-tostones-maduros-platanos-fritos/), chatinos, fufú |
| **Ripening** | Yellow with spots | Semi-firm | Boiled, in ajiaco |
| **Ripe** | Black/very yellow | Soft, sweet | Fried maduros, in tentación |

**Tostones** (green plantain fried and smashed twice) are arguably Cuba's most popular fried vianda, present at virtually every meal.

## Calabaza: Tropical Sweetness

[Cuban squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_moschata) is sweeter and firmer than North American varieties. It's used in both savory and sweet dishes:

- In **ajiaco**: Adds body and natural sweetness
- **Boiled with mojo**: As a vianda side dish
- **Calabaza flan**: Traditional holiday dessert
- In **potajes**: Naturally thickens broths

## Viandas in Cuban History

Viandas aren't just food — they're **living history**. Fernando Ortiz, Cuba's great ethnologist, used the [ajiaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajiaco) as a metaphor for Cuban identity: a pot where Taíno tubers, African roots, and Spanish traditions all simmer together.

### Timeline of Cuban viandas

- **Pre-1492**: The Taíno cultivate cassava, sweet potato, and corn
- **16th-18th centuries**: Yam and malanga arrive with enslaved Africans
- **19th century**: Plantain becomes a commercial crop
- **1990-2000**: During the [Special Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period), viandas save Cuba from hunger when other foods vanish
- **2020s**: Vianda shortages on the island spur urban agriculture

## Where to Buy Cuban Viandas in the U.S.

For the diaspora missing the taste of home:

- **[Sedano's](https://www.sedanos.com/)**: The quintessential Cuban grocery chain in Florida — always stocks malanga, boniato, yuca, and plantains
- **[Presidente Supermarkets](https://www.presidente.com/)**: Excellent tropical produce section in Miami-Dade
- **[Goya Foods](https://www.goya.com/)**: Offers frozen yuca and malanga purees nationwide
- **Amazon Fresh**: Malanga, boniato, and yuca available in select areas
- **Farmers' markets**: In South Florida and New York, local growers cultivate tropical varieties

## Tips for Cooking Viandas

1. **Always start in cold water**: Place viandas in cold water, then bring to a boil. Starting in hot water toughens the outside
2. **Salt at the end**: Add salt when they're nearly tender
3. **Hot mojo**: Pour sizzling [mojo criollo](/en/blog/2026-02-11-mojo-criollo-salsa-cubana/) over freshly boiled viandas so they absorb all the flavor
4. **Don't overcook**: Cassava and malanga fall apart quickly if overcooked
5. **Storage**: Keep raw viandas in a cool, dry place — never in the fridge (except cut boniato)

*Viandas are Cuba in its most elemental form: generous earth that nourishes without pretension. From the Taíno conuco to your grandmother's table in Hialeah, these humble tubers are the true treasure of our gastronomy.*
