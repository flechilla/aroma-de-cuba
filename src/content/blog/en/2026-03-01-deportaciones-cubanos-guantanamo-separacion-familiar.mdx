While Cuban families in the United States await news of their loved ones, **54 Cuban citizens remain detained at Guantanamo Naval Base** after being designated for deportation from U.S. territory. This unprecedented migration strategy is raising questions about human rights and the future of immigration policies toward Cuba.

## The Route to Guantanamo: A New Migration Reality

According to ICE flight records monitored by human rights organizations, the Trump administration has sent **three deportation flights** to the Guantanamo base:

- **December 19, 2025**: First flight
- **January 9, 2026**: Second flight  
- **February 9, 2026**: Third flight with deportees finally transferred to Cuba

In total, **54 Cuban citizens** have gone through this intermediate detention process at Guantanamo, a situation their families describe as "limbo within limbo."

## Families in Uncertainty

María González, whose husband was detained on the first flight, recounts the anguish of not understanding why Cubans weren't sent directly to Havana like in previous deportations:

> "We wonder why our sons, husbands, and nephews weren't sent to Cuba, where 1,498 Cuban citizens were deported last year on monthly flights, or to a third country like Mexico, where 4,883 were sent in 2025."

This quote reflects the widespread confusion about the criteria determining these migration decisions.

## Why Guantanamo? Strategy Analysis

Immigration experts point to several possible reasons for this new practice:

### 1. **Diplomatic Pressure**
Using Guantanamo could be a tactic to pressure the Cuban government into accepting more direct deportees.

### 2. **Selection Criteria**
Deportees to Guantanamo might meet specific criteria requiring additional processing before final transfer.

### 3. **Processing Capacity**
The naval base offers detention facilities that allow for more detailed evaluations before final deportation.

## The Context of Mass Deportations

This strategy fits within the Trump administration's broader deportation program, which has shown a hardened approach toward Cuban migrants:

- **170 Cubans deported** in February 2026, including people with criminal backgrounds
- **Elimination of the CHNV program** that protected half a million migrants
- **Work permit restrictions** for asylum seekers

## Legal and Humanitarian Impact

### Rights in Question

Immigration attorneys are challenging the legality of using Guantanamo as a migration processing center:

- **Due process**: Do they have adequate access to legal representation?
- **Detention conditions**: Do they meet standards for civilians?
- **Indeterminate duration**: How long can they remain detained?

### Historical Precedent

This isn't the first time Guantanamo has housed Cuban migrants. During the 1990s migration crisis, **33,000 Cubans** were detained at the base before being repatriated or resettled.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who is being sent to Guantanamo?

Specific criteria haven't been publicly revealed, but it appears to include people with complex cases or those requiring additional evaluation before final deportation.

### How long do they remain at Guantanamo?

Detention times vary. Some have been there for months, while others were transferred to Cuba on the February flight.

### Can families communicate with them?

Communication is limited and controlled by the base's military authorities.

### Is this practice legal?

Human rights advocates are challenging the legality of using military facilities for civilian immigration detention.

## The Uncertain Future

While families wait, the Trump administration continues implementing increasingly restrictive immigration policies. **The case of the 54 Cubans at Guantanamo** could establish a precedent for future deportees from the island and other countries.

The situation highlights the need for comprehensive immigration reform that respects both national security and fundamental human rights.
