Coffee growers in the Sierra Maestra are experiencing a historic moment.
This year's harvest, favored by timely rains and the adoption of
agroecological techniques, is producing beans of a quality not seen
since the golden years of Cuban coffee.

## The Return of a Coffee Giant

Cuba was once one of the world's largest coffee exporters. The industry
suffered decades of decline, but a new revitalization program is bearing
fruit — literally.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Fun fact">
  Cuban coffee is primarily grown in the mountainous regions of eastern
  Cuba, where the altitude and microclimate create ideal conditions for
  Arabica beans.

## New Techniques, Old Traditions

Producers are combining ancestral knowledge with modern sustainable
farming methods. The result is a bean that tasters describe as "complex,
with notes of dark chocolate and tropical citrus."

<CubanQuote author="María Elena Rodríguez, coffee grower">
  My grandfather used to say the best coffee is made with patience and
  love. We've added science, but love remains the main ingredient.
</CubanQuote>

## The Future of Cuban Coffee

Authorities expect this harvest to mark the beginning of a new era for
Cuban coffee in international markets, where demand for specialty and
single-origin coffees continues to grow.
