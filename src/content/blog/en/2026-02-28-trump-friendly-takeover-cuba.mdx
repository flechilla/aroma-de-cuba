U.S. President **Donald Trump** has sparked international debate by suggesting the possibility of a **"friendly and controlled takeover"** of Cuba. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump stated that the Cuban regime is in a desperate situation due to a lack of resources and fuel, creating an opening for a major shift on the island.

### Marco Rubio Leading High-Level Talks

Trump emphasized that Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** is handling the matter at a "very high level." These remarks bolster previous reports concerning secret contacts between the U.S. administration and Cuban government representatives seeking a resolution to the island's deepening crisis.

Analysts suggest Washington's strategy is not military-focused but rather aimed at strategic influence through energy and diplomatic control. Deprived of Venezuelan support and facing heavy economic pressure from Washington, the Cuban model is facing its most vulnerable moment in decades.

### A Nation in Darkness

Trump's proposal comes as Cuba faces an unprecedented energy collapse, with blackouts affecting over 60% of the national territory. The lack of hard currency to import fuel has paralyzed key industries, including tourism, long the engine of the Cuban economy.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What does a "friendly takeover" mean according to Trump?**
It refers to a negotiated regime change or transition process, leveraging the island's economic weakness to establish a model aligned with U.S. interests of freedom and democracy without direct military intervention.

**2. What is Marco Rubio's role in this?**
As Secretary of State, Rubio is the chief architect of policy toward Cuba, leading high-level discussions and diplomatic pressure to force an economic and political opening.

**3. How has the Cuban government reacted?**
Havana's official response has been one of rejection, labeling U.S. pressure as an attempt at "suffocation," though secret negotiations hint at a more pragmatic dialogue behind the scenes.

**4. Will this affect remittances and travel?**
Likely yes. Any humanitarian or political deal would foreseeably involve restructuring currency flows and travel licenses, contingent upon concessions made by the Cuban regime.
