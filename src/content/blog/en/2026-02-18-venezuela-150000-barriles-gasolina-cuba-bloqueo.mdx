Amid the most severe oil blockade in decades, Venezuela is not giving up. A tanker that has transported Venezuelan fuel to Cuba since April 2025 finished loading **150,000 barrels of gasoline** destined for the island this week, according to a shipping schedule reviewed by Reuters.

## Trump's Energy Siege

Since early February 2026, the Trump administration intercepted tankers carrying Venezuelan crude and threatened tariffs against any nation that dares to supply Havana. The results: canceled flights, extended blackouts, industrial shutdowns, and the 2026 Habano Festival suspended.

## Caracas Pushes Back

Despite the risk of commercial retaliation, Venezuela has maintained a reduced supply line. The 150,000-barrel cargo covers barely three days of minimum consumption in Cuba, but sends a clear political signal: Caracas remains willing to defy Washington.

## A Geopolitical Test

Mexico sent two ships with humanitarian aid to Havana in February, and Russia announced plans to send crude shipments. What is happening in the Caribbean is not just an energy crisis — it is a geopolitical standoff between Washington and a bloc of countries rejecting unilateral US pressure.

For now, the Venezuelan tanker sails on. And with it travels something more than gasoline.
