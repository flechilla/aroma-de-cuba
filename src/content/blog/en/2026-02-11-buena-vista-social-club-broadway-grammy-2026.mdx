Cuban music has once again conquered the world's most prestigious stages. On Sunday, February 9th, the Broadway musical **Buena Vista Social Club** won the [Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album](https://www.grammy.com/) at the 68th annual ceremony, defeating favorites like *Maybe Happy Ending* and *Death Becomes Her*.

## From Legendary Album to Broadway Stage

The musical is inspired by the [iconic 1997 album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(album)) that rescued veteran Cuban musicians from obscurity and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. Produced by [Ry Cooder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry_Cooder) and recorded at the legendary EGREM studios in Havana, that album became a cultural phenomenon that introduced [son cubano](/en/blog/changui-guantanamo-raiz-son-cubano/) to new generations.

The musical, with a book by Marco Ramirez, follows the lives of four prominent musicians from the vibrant clubs of 1950s Havana, through the turbulent political changes after the revolution, to their magical 1997 reunion.

## A Triumph for Spanish-Language Music

What makes this musical unique is that **all the music is performed in Spanish**—rare for Broadway. Cuban genres—son, [danzón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danz%C3%B3n), bolero—come alive on stage with iconic songs like "Chan Chan," "Dos Gardenias," and "Lágrimas Negras."

> "This music speaks to audiences around the world who don't even speak Spanish," said producer Dean Sharenow while accepting the Grammy.

## Total Success at the 2025 Tony Awards

The Grammy crowns a triumphant season for the musical, which won **five Tony Awards** in June 2025:

- **Best Featured Actress**: [Natalie Venetia Belcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Venetia_Belcon) as Omara Portuondo
- **Best Choreography**: Patricia Delgado and [Justin Peck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Peck)
- **Best Orchestrations**: Marco Paguia
- **Best Sound Design**: Jonathan Deans
- **Special Tony Award**: The musical's live band

The onstage band—featuring piano, tres cubano, trumpet, trombone, and percussion—received special recognition for its authenticity and virtuosity.

## Lin-Manuel Miranda Joins the Party

The success continues to grow. [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda), creator of *Hamilton*, will host a special "Dance Along" performance on **March 26, 2026**, where audiences can dance from their seats to the rhythms of son cubano.

The musical also paid tribute to [Bad Bunny](/en/blog/musica-cubana-grammy-2026/) after his historic Super Bowl LX halftime performance, where the Puerto Rican star celebrated Latin culture with flags from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and other American nations.

## A Legacy That Transcends Generations

The original Buena Vista Social Club brought together legends like:

- **[Omara Portuondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omara_Portuondo)**: The "Bride of Filin," still performing at 94
- **[Ibrahim Ferrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Ferrer)**: The singer discovered while shining shoes
- **[Compay Segundo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compay_Segundo)**: Creator of the armónico and "Chan Chan"
- **[Rubén González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Gonz%C3%A1lez_(pianist))**: The virtuoso pianist who played until his final days

Many of these artists have passed away, but their music continues to capture hearts. The Broadway musical is testament that son cubano—that perfect fusion of African rhythms and Spanish melodies—knows no borders or eras.

## Where to See It

*Buena Vista Social Club* is currently playing at the **Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre** in New York City. For those who can't travel, the cast album is available on all streaming platforms.
