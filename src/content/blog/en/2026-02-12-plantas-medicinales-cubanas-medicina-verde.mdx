In every Cuban patio, balcony, and courtyard grows a natural pharmacy. From the mountains of eastern Cuba to Havana's urban gardens, **medicinal plants** have been the first line of health defense for millions of Cubans for centuries. It's not just tradition — it's a living knowledge system that the Cuban government officially recognized in 1991 with its **Green Medicine** (*Medicina Verde*) program.

## Roots of an Ancient Tradition

Cuban herbal medicine is a cultural melting pot. The indigenous Taíno people already used plants like **tobacco** (*Nicotiana tabacum*) in healing rituals and **guásima** bark for ailments. With the arrival of enslaved Africans, healing practices from the continent merged with Yoruba religion — in [Cuban Santería](/en/blog/santeria-cubana-religion-orishas/), each orisha has sacred plants called *ewé*.

Chinese immigrants in the 19th century brought species like **bitter melon** (*cundeamor*) and **chinaberry** (*paraíso*), further expanding the island's botanical repertoire. The result: a unique ethnobotanical system with over **1,500 documented medicinal species**.

## The 12 Essential Plants of Cuban Green Medicine

### 1. Aloe Vera (*Sábila*)
The undisputed queen of the Cuban patio. Its fleshy leaves contain a gel with **wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and digestive** properties. Applied directly to burns, cuts, and skin conditions. Also consumed as juice for stomach acidity. Cuba produces [natural cosmetics](/en/blog/cosmeticos-naturales-cubanos/) based on aloe vera.

### 2. Chamomile (*Manzanilla*)
The universal remedy of the Cuban grandmother. A chamomile infusion calms the stomach, reduces anxiety, and helps induce sleep. Also used as a hair rinse and as an anti-inflammatory compress.

### 3. Lemongrass (*Caña Santa*)
Known locally as *hierba de limón* or *limoncillo*, it's perhaps Cuba's most popular herbal tea. A cup of "**caña santa tea**" after meals is a national ritual: digestive, relaxing, and delicious. It grows wild across the island.

### 4. Cuban Oregano (*Orégano Francés*)
Called "orégano orejón" for its thick, velvety leaves, it's the star remedy for **coughs and asthma**. Crushed leaves with warm oil are applied as a chest poultice. Mixed with [Cuban honey](/en/blog/miel-cubana-organica-tesoro-caribe/), it makes an unbeatable homemade cough syrup.

### 5. Basil (*Albahaca*)
More than a seasoning: basil relieves headaches, improves mood, and fights colds. In Afro-Cuban tradition, it's the sacred herb of **Obatalá** and is used in spiritual cleansings (*despojos*).

### 6. Bitter Melon (*Cundeamor*)
This bitter fruit is the traditional remedy for **diabetes** and skin problems. Cuban grandmothers swear it "purifies the blood." Modern scientific studies confirm it contains compounds with [hypoglycemic action](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), validating folk wisdom.

### 7. Guinea Hen Weed (*Anamú*)
A tropical plant with a strong garlic-like smell, considered a powerful **immune stimulant**. Used to strengthen defenses, as an anti-inflammatory, and for respiratory conditions. In Santería, it's an herb of **Babalú Ayé**.

### 8. Cuban Linden (*Tilo*)
Cuban *tilo* isn't European linden, but it serves the same purpose: **calming the nerves**. An infusion before bed is the most prescribed natural anxiolytic in Cuba's green medicine clinics.

### 9. Bitter Broom (*Escoba Amarga*)
Effective against joint pain, arthritis, and muscle soreness. Its diuretic properties help eliminate excess fluids, and it also combats coughs and colds.

### 10. Guásima (*Guazuma ulmifolia*)
A native tree with potent **anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antioxidant** effects. Bark decoction is a traditional remedy for diarrhea and digestive problems.

### 11. Sage (*Salvia*)
Rich in antioxidants, sage strengthens the immune system. Prepared as an infusion for respiratory problems and used as a gargle for sore throats.

### 12. Star Anise (*Anís Estrellado*)
Arriving from Asia through Chinese immigration, it's the go-to remedy for **gas, colic, and indigestion**. Its sweet flavor makes it one of the most pleasant teas in Cuban herbalism.

## The Green Medicine Program

In 1991, facing the economic crisis of the [Special Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period), Cuba institutionalized herbal medicine. The Ministry of Public Health created the **Traditional and Natural Medicine (TNM)** program, which includes:

- **Green pharmacies** (*farmacias verdes*) in every municipality
- Industrial production of herbal medicines by laboratories like [LABIOFAM](https://www.labiofam.cu/)
- Scientific research at centers like CIDEM (Center for Drug Research and Development)
- Integration of herbalism into primary healthcare

Today Cuba produces over **60 registered herbal medicines**, from Cuban oregano syrups to lemongrass tablets, available in pharmacies nationwide.

## How Green Remedies Are Prepared

### Infusion
The simplest method. Pour **hot water** (not boiling) over leaves, flowers, or tender plant parts and steep for 5-10 minutes. Ideal for chamomile, linden, and lemongrass.

### Decoction
For hard parts like roots, bark, and stems. Boil the plant for **10-20 minutes** and strain. The preferred method for guásima, star anise, and bitter melon.

### Poultice
Fresh leaves are crushed and applied directly to the affected area, sometimes with warm oil. Cuban oregano on the chest for coughs is the classic example.

### Syrup
Plant juice is mixed with honey or sugar. Cuban oregano syrups with [Cuban honey](/en/blog/miel-cubana-organica-tesoro-caribe/) are a home remedy found in practically every Cuban household.

## Where to Find Cuban Medicinal Plants

In Cuba, plants are found at **organopónicos** (urban gardens), farmers' markets, green pharmacies, and of course, in the neighbor's yard. In the diaspora:

- **Miami**: Botánicas and herb shops on Calle Ocho and in Hialeah offer fresh and dried herbs
- **Online**: Shops on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cuban+herbs) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=cuban+herbs) carry dried Caribbean herbs
- **Grow your own**: Many of these plants thrive in pots in warm climates across Florida, Texas, and California

## A Pharmacy That Never Closes

Cuban green medicine isn't a wellness trend or a new-age fad — it's a complementary health system with centuries of experience and growing scientific backing. In a country where pharmaceutical resources have always been limited, medicinal plants represent **resilience, identity, and collective wisdom**.

As the Cuban saying goes: *"He who has a patio has a pharmacy"* — *"El que tiene patio, tiene farmacia."*
