If there's one flavor that defines Cuban cuisine, it's **mojo criollo**. This aromatic sauce of garlic, sour orange, and spices is the soul of iconic dishes like [roast pork (lechón)](/en/blog/2026-02-11-dulces-tradicionales-cubanos/) and yuca con mojo. Without mojo, there simply is no Cuban Christmas Eve.

## Origins of Mojo Criollo

The word *mojo* comes from the Portuguese *molho* (sauce). It arrived in Cuba through the Canary Islands, where Canarian *mojos*—green and red—accompany potatoes and meats. In Cuba, mojo transformed with local ingredients: **sour orange** (*Citrus aurantium*), abundant on the island, gave it its unique character.

African slaves and Cuban peasants perfected the technique of marinating meats with this mixture, creating a flavor that today is synonymous with *cubanía* (Cuban identity).

## Traditional Ingredients

### The Mojo Base

| Ingredient | Amount | Function |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Fresh garlic | 10-12 cloves | Main flavor |
| Sour orange | 1 cup juice | Characteristic acidity |
| Olive oil | ½ cup | Flavor vehicle |
| Ground cumin | 1 teaspoon | Earthy depth |
| Dried oregano | 1 teaspoon | Herbal aroma |
| Salt | To taste | Enhances flavors |

### Sour Orange: The Secret Ingredient

[Sour orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange) (*Citrus aurantium*) is the ingredient that makes Cuban mojo unique. Its juice combines the acidity of lemon with floral notes of orange, creating a profile impossible to replicate exactly.

**If you can't find sour orange:**
- Mix ¾ cup sweet orange juice + ¼ cup lime juice
- Or use ½ cup grapefruit juice + ½ cup lime juice
- [Goya sells bottled sour orange juice](https://www.goya.com/en/products/sour-orange) in Latin supermarkets

## Traditional Mojo Criollo Recipe

### Ingredients
- 12 large garlic cloves
- 1 cup sour orange juice
- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper

### Preparation

1. **Crush the garlic** in a pilón (mortar) with salt until it forms a paste. The mortar releases more oils than a processor.

2. **Heat the oil** over medium heat in a pan. It shouldn't smoke.

3. **Sauté the garlic paste** for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. The garlic should lightly brown, never burn.

4. **Remove from heat** and immediately add the sour orange juice. Careful: it will splatter.

5. **Add the spices** (cumin, oregano, pepper) and mix well.

6. **Let it rest** at least 30 minutes before using. Mojo improves with time.

> **Cuban grandmother's tip:** The mojo should "sing" when the juice hits the hot oil. That sound means it's at its perfect point.

## Uses for Mojo Criollo

### Roast Pork (Lechón Asado)
The most emblematic use. Mojo is injected into the pork and marinated for 24-48 hours before roasting. During cooking, it's constantly basted with more mojo.

### Yuca con Mojo
Boiled cassava is served covered in hot mojo. The yuca's starch absorbs the flavors creating a perfect accompaniment. It's the mandatory side dish in any traditional Cuban meal.

### Grilled Chicken
Marinate chicken breasts for 2-4 hours before grilling. The result is juicy and full of flavor.

### Tostones and Maduros
A drizzle of mojo over freshly fried tostones elevates this snack to another level.
