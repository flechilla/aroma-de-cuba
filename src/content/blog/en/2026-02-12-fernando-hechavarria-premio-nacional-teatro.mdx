Cuban actor **Fernando Hechavarría Gibert** has been awarded the **2026 National Theater Prize**, Cuba's highest honor for distinguished figures in the performing arts.

## A Unanimous Decision

The jury of the [National Council of Performing Arts](https://www.cnae.cult.cu/) reached the decision unanimously, recognizing a career spanning **more than 50 years** dedicated to theater, film, television, and training new generations of actors.

> "Theater offers you the continuity of performing from beginning to end, making each show something unique and unrepeatable"
> — Fernando Hechavarría

## From Escambray to El Público

Born in [Holguín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holgu%C3%ADn) on September 16, 1955, Hechavarría began his training at the Provincial School of Visual Arts before graduating from the **National School of Art** in acting in 1976.

His career took a defining turn when he joined the legendary **Teatro Escambray** in 1978. What started as two years of social service became two decades of work:

*"I came for two years of social service and stayed twenty. It gave me so much technically, culturally, and ethically,"* the actor recalled in an interview with [OnCuba](https://oncubanews.com/cultura/teatro/fernando-hechavarria-adoro-ese-contacto-directo-con-el-espectador-que-solo-el-teatro-ofrece/).

[Teatro Escambray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Teatro_Escambray), founded in 1968 in the mountains of Villa Clara, pioneered community theater in Cuba and became a reference for the collective creation method.

## Teatro El Público: Artistic Maturity

Since 1995, Hechavarría has been part of **Teatro El Público**, the company led by provocative director **Carlos Díaz**. With this collective, he has starred in productions that have marked Havana's theater scene:

- **King Lear** (William Shakespeare)
- **Caligula** (Albert Camus)
- **The Seagull** (Anton Chekhov)
- **The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant** (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)

*"It's my most precious way of engaging with today's Cuba, and the ideal mode of expression as an artist and as a Cuban,"* he said of his bond with the company.

## A Monumental Career

The numbers speak for themselves:

| Medium | Appearances |
|--------|-------------|
| Theater | Over 36 productions |
| Film | 31 movies |
| Television | 44 productions |
| Festivals | 27 national and international |

On television, his portrayal of **Nacho Capitán** made him a beloved face among Cuban audiences, appearing in series like *Tierra Brava*, *Cuando el agua regresa a la tierra*, and *Las huérfanas de la Obrapía*.

## The Teacher

Beyond his prolific acting career, Hechavarría dedicates time to teaching as a professor of acting at the **University of the Arts (ISA)** and the **Corina Mestre National Theater School**.

*"It's not enough to know the subject; it's vital to lead by example and encourage the individual growth of each budding artist,"* he noted about his teaching philosophy.

## Previous Recognitions

The 2026 National Theater Prize joins other honors:

- **Best Supporting Actor in Television** for *Aire frío*
- **Best Male Performance in Film** for *Pon tu pensamiento en mí*
- **Replica of Generalissimo Máximo Gómez's Machete** (2021)

## A Living Legacy

At 70, Fernando Hechavarría represents the best of Cuban theater: a career built on artistic rigor, community commitment, and total dedication to the stage.

From the Escambray mountains to Havana's stages, his trajectory testifies that in Cuba, theater remains a living, necessary, and deeply human art form.
