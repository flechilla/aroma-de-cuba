A wave of criticism flooded social media following the latest Mesa Redonda broadcast, where Cuban authorities addressed the energy crisis, banking operations, and international aid. Far from calming tempers, the program generated distrust, annoyance, and direct complaints from the public.

## "They No Longer Deceive Anyone"

In comments posted during and after the broadcast, numerous users questioned the truthfulness of the official speech and the lack of real solutions, according to [CiberCuba](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-10-u1-e135253-s27061-nid320473-todo-mentira-enganan-nadie-estallan-criticas-tras).

Alejandro Pérez Guilarte stated that after more than six decades, "the amount of money stolen from the people" explains the current situation. Michel Mantilla declared that "they no longer deceive anyone."

Roberto López questioned where the concrete results are for the Cuban table, while Layter Rodríguez labeled the program as "more of the same," calling for less talk and more action.

## Banking Complaints

Criticism also focused on banking services. Mar reported that banks practically don't operate when power goes out, and Zoila García Perera stated that in rural provinces, ATMs don't work for withdrawing money or making transfers due to lack of electrical supply.

Luis Medrano summarized his discontent stating that "this is what banks are going to offer the ordinary Cuban."

## Social Demands

There were also direct social claims:

- **Ivonne González** expressed desperation over the lack of milk for children
- **Yayi Dallarys Benítez** reported that transportation for hemodialysis patients is no longer guaranteed
- **Carlos Miguel González Pupo** criticized the silence about political prisoners

## "How to Stay Informed Without Power?"

The lack of electricity was another focal point of criticism. Charly Ok and Carima Borges pointed out they couldn't even watch the full program due to blackouts, while Delvis Cruz Limonta sarcastically commented on how to stay informed if "there's never any power."

The reactions reflect a climate of exhaustion and growing skepticism among Cubans, who contrast official rhetoric with a reality marked by blackouts, shortages, poor services, and deep loss of trust.
