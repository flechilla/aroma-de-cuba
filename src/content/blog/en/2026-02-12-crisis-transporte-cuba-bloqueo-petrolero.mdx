faq:
  - question: "Why is there a transport crisis in Cuba?"
    answer: "The oil blockade imposed by the United States has cut fuel supplies to the island, leaving state transport services inoperative and drastically reducing private transport options."
  - question: "How much does transport cost in Cuba during the crisis?"
    answer: "Fares have doubled. Common Havana routes like Centro Habana to Cerro or Marianao now cost 300-400 Cuban pesos, twice the normal price."
  - question: "What transport alternatives exist in Cuba now?"
    answer: "Electric tricycles have emerged as an alternative, though their capacity falls far short of demand. Their operators maintain regular prices and offer concessions to vulnerable people."
  - question: "How long will Cuba's transport crisis last?"
    answer: "According to taxi drivers and transport workers, the situation will worsen in coming weeks unless new fuel shipments arrive. The last oil tanker docked in January 2026."

The fuel crisis caused by the [US oil blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-corta-envios-petroleo-cuba-primera-vez-decada/) has hit Cuba's public and private transport head-on, leaving millions without mobility options and doubling fares for the few alternatives still running.

## State Transport: Virtually Shut Down

State transportation services are **virtually paralyzed**. Buses connecting neighborhoods and provinces have drastically reduced their frequencies, while interprovincial routes operate under severe limitations.

The situation is compounded by Cuba's [pre-existing chronic transport deficit](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/economia/se-va-a-poner-peor-crisis-del-transporte-tras-el-bloqueo-petrolero-a-cuba/), with an aging fleet entirely dependent on imported fossil fuels.

## Private Taxis: No Fuel for Tomorrow

"The situation is very critical—we don't have fuel to work. The CUPET station that supplies us isn't getting any either, they won't sell in US dollars anymore, and there are practically no cars left," one taxi driver at the El Curita park in Centro Habana, one of the city's busiest taxi stands, told [OnCuba](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/economia/se-va-a-poner-peor-crisis-del-transporte-tras-el-bloqueo-petrolero-a-cuba/).

"I have enough to work today, but for tomorrow I don't, and that's how it is for all of us," he added.

The *piqueras*—informal taxi stands where collective taxis organize routes—show a **notable decrease** in activity. Fares for common routes like Centro Habana to Cerro or Marianao now range between **300 and 400 pesos**, double the usual rate.

## Fares Double Across the Board

Interprovincial transport is also suffering. A passenger headed to Cárdenas in Matanzas province confirmed that **her fare had doubled**. The combination of scarcity and high demand creates perfect conditions for price inflation.

This increase compounds an already dire situation where the [dollar has surpassed 500 Cuban pesos](/en/blog/2026-02-10-dolar-rompe-barrera-500-pesos-cubanos/) on the black market, further eroding people's purchasing power.

## Electric Tricycles: The Insufficient Alternative

Electric tricycles have emerged as one of the few viable options, but their capacity falls far short of meeting demand in a city like Havana.

A tricycle driver noted the visible decrease in cars on the road, while the number of people seeking transport remains unchanged. On the positive side, these operators are maintaining their regular prices.

"We have to be considerate, because we need to help each other—this is not the time to take advantage of the situation," one driver said, offering concessions to vulnerable passengers.

## A Domino Effect on Daily Life

Transport disruptions have a **cascading effect** on nearly every aspect of Cuban life. In fact, many of the [emergency measures implemented by the government](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-medidas-emergencia-universidades-hospitales/)—including the four-day work week and university closures—are a direct response to people's inability to get around.

Meanwhile, the island also faces [record blackouts affecting 64% of the country](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) and the [suspension of international flights](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba/) due to aviation fuel shortages.

People are trying to carry on with as much normalcy as possible, but remain braced for what may come in the weeks ahead if new fuel supplies don't reach the island.
