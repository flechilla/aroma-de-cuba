The Government of Mexico has intensified its support for Cuba in the midst of one of the deepest energy and supply crises in its recent history. This Tuesday, two Mexican Navy vessels, the **Papaloapan** and the **Huasteco**, set sail from the port of Veracruz carrying **1,193 tons of humanitarian aid**.

This new delivery comes just weeks after other Mexican ships arrived on the island, underscoring Mexico's position as a key ally in the face of the energy siege suffocating the Cuban economy.

### What does the new shipment contain?

The cargo, sent through the Secretariat of the Navy (Semar) and the Mexican Foreign Ministry, prioritizes basic products that have practically disappeared from the Cuban retail network and rationing system:

1.  **Legumes:** More than 1,000 tons of beans.
2.  **Dairy:** Powdered milk intended for the vulnerable population.
3.  **Basic supplies:** Vegetable oil, rice, and canned products such as tuna and sardines.
4.  **Hygiene:** Personal care items for the civilian population.

### The context of an unprecedented crisis

The dispatch of these ships occurs at a critical moment. Cuba is facing an electricity deficit that has exceeded **1,700 MW**, leaving more than 60% of the country in the dark simultaneously. The lack of fuel not only turns off homes but has also paralyzed the logistics of distributing international aid itself, as recently reported by the UN.

Mexico, under the administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, has maintained a constant flow of humanitarian aid (food and medicine) despite having temporarily suspended oil shipments in early February—a move forced by U.S. tariff pressures and Mexico's own domestic demand.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Which ships are participating in this mission?**
The logistical support vessels Papaloapan (A-411) and Huasteco (AMP-01) of the Mexican Navy.

**When will the aid arrive in Cuba?**
The ships are estimated to reach the port of Havana or Mariel within 3 to 5 days after leaving Veracruz.

**Is this the first aid from Mexico in 2026?**
No, it is the second major shipment of the month. In mid-February, the vessels Papaloapan and Isla Holbox arrived with over 800 tons.

**Why is Mexico sending food instead of oil?**
While Mexico has been a historical supplier of crude oil, the current political situation and threats of sanctions have shifted support toward direct humanitarian aid to alleviate the urgent food shortage.
