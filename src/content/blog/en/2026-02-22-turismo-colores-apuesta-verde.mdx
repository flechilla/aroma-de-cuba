In the midst of one of the worst economic and energy crises in its history, Cuba's Ministry of Tourism has launched a new advertising narrative called **"Turismo de Colores"** (Tourism of Colors). This initiative seeks to divert attention from the traditional (and currently precarious) model of large beach hotels toward a more intimate offer linked to the virgin geography of the island.

### "Green" as a Lifeline
The bet on ecotourism is not accidental. While large hotels in Varadero and the Cayos suffer from fuel shortages for air conditioning and industrial laundries, nature destinations like **Viñales Valley** or the **Ciénaga de Zapata** operate with a much smaller energy footprint. Many of these tourists stay in private homes (casas particulares) that, while also subject to blackouts, offer a more adaptable and authentic experience for the adventure traveler.

### Forced Diversification
The collapse of traditional markets forced authorities to search for "other colors." **"Blue"** focuses on diving and nautical centers that do not require massive electrical supplies, while **"Brown"** highlights tobacco and coffee routes in the Sierra Maestra. This segmentation attempts to attract a traveler profile with higher purchasing power and environmental awareness, willing to sacrifice luxury comforts for cultural immersion experiences.

### Infrastructure Challenges
Despite official optimism, green tourism faces the same obstacles as the rest of the country: poorly maintained roads, interprovincial transport nearly paralyzed by lack of gasoline, and shortages of basic foods to offer quality service.

Can nature save an industry accustomed to volume and all-inclusive packages? 2026 will be the testing ground to see if Cuba can reinvent itself under the banner of sustainability before the tourism engine shuts down completely.
