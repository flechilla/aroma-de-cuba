The White House insisted Thursday that the United States and Cuba are maintaining negotiations—a claim that Miguel Díaz-Canel's government continues to deny—while urging Havana to be "prudent" in its statements.

## "The President Always Pursues Diplomacy"

At a press briefing, White House spokesperson **Karoline Leavitt** responded to questions about recent statements from the Cuban government:

> "As I have reiterated, President Trump always has the will to pursue diplomacy, and I believe that is something that is indeed taking place with the Cuban government."

## Direct Warning to Havana

Leavitt went further, issuing a direct warning to Díaz-Canel's government:

> "I think that, given that the Cuban government is on its last legs and the country is about to collapse, they should be prudent in their statements directed at the President of the United States."

## Cuba Denies Formal Negotiations

The White House's statements contrast with those of Díaz-Canel himself, who denied that formal negotiations are underway with Washington.

The Cuban president stated that Cuba is willing to dialogue, but **"without coercion"** and under conditions of respect and equality.

## Maximum Pressure Context

These statements come at a moment of peak bilateral tension:

- Following Nicolás Maduro's capture on January 3, Venezuela ceased oil shipments to Cuba
- Trump signed an executive order to sanction countries that send crude to the island
- Washington has stated that the Cuban government is "on the verge of collapse"

Trump himself has repeatedly claimed that Díaz-Canel's government's days are numbered due to the energy crisis facing the island.
