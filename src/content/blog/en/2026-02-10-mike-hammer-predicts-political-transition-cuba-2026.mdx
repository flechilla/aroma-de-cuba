Mike Hammer, the highest-ranking US diplomat in Havana, has declared that the Cuban regime "will not survive 2026," sending a message of hope to the Cuban people amid the most severe crisis the island has faced in decades.

## "Change Is Coming"

In statements reported by [Univision](https://www.univision.com/local/miami-wltv/jefe-de-mision-diplomatica-de-eeuu-en-la-habana-dice-que-se-acerca-un-cambio-en-cuba-video) and [Telemundo News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEH5k4qzjYs), Hammer described a scenario marked by economic crisis, energy collapse, and growing popular discontent.

The head of the US mission in Cuba emphasized that the United States is not responsible for the economic crisis the island is experiencing and demanded press freedom and the release of political prisoners.

## Tours Through the Provinces

In recent weeks, Hammer has toured various Cuban provinces, visiting communities affected by the crisis and verifying the distribution of humanitarian aid sent by the Trump administration.

According to [Martí Noticias](https://www.martinoticias.com/a/embajador-hammer-cumple-encomienda-de-rubio-visita-a-m%C3%A1s-cubanos-y-promete-ayuda-adicional-video/446699.html), the diplomat promised additional aid working in coordination with Caritas Cuba and the Bishopric.

"I came from Havana because we want to see if the humanitarian aid sent by the Trump Administration is reaching those most affected and in need," Hammer explained during a visit to Holguín province.

## Diplomatic Tensions

Hammer's statements have generated tensions. The Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs has denounced acts of intimidation against the diplomat during his tours and demanded that the "illegitimate Cuban regime" cease its repressive acts against embassy personnel.

The [US Embassy in Cuba](https://twitter.com/USEmbCuba) also issued a security alert citing "increased protests" and "anti-American rhetoric" on the island.

## Context: Unprecedented Crisis

Hammer's statements come at a time when Cuba faces:
