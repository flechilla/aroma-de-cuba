Santiago de Cuba is preparing once again to welcome the heirs of a tradition born in its streets over a century ago. From **February 26 to March 1, 2026**, the eastern city will celebrate the **61st edition of the International Pepe Sánchez Trova Festival**, Cuba's oldest musical event dedicated to this unique genre.

## The Legacy of Pepe Sánchez

José Vivanco Sánchez Hecheverría, known as [Pepe Sánchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_S%C3%A1nchez_(trova)), was born in Santiago de Cuba on March 19, 1856. A tailor by trade and musician at heart, he never formally studied music. Yet his natural talent led him to create something that would forever change Latin American music: **the first bolero**.

In 1883, Pepe composed "Tristezas" (Sorrows), a piece that specialists recognize as the birth of the [bolero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolero) as a genre. With guitar and voice, without sheet music or academic training, this mulatto from Santiago established the foundations of what would become Cuban trova.

> "Tristezas me dan tus quejas, mujer; profundo dolor que dudes de mí..."
> (Your complaints bring me sorrow, woman; deep pain that you doubt me...)

Thus began the song that inaugurated a genre that would conquer all of Latin America.

## Trova: Guitar, Voice, and Poetry

[Cuban trova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trova) is more than a musical genre; it's a way of life. The trovadores—itinerant musicians who roamed the streets of eastern Cuba with their guitars—sang about love, heartbreak, homeland, and the small stories of everyday life.

Unlike other Cuban genres, trova is intimate. It doesn't require an orchestra or grand stages. It only needs a guitar, a voice, and something to say.

### The Four Greats

After Pepe Sánchez came those history calls **"the four greats of trova"**:

- **[Sindo Garay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindo_Garay)** (1867-1968): A prolific composer who lived 101 years, leaving classics like "La Bayamesa" and "Perla marina."
- **[Manuel Corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Corona_(musician))** (1880-1950): The troubadour of Havana's neighborhoods.
- **[Alberto Villalón](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Villal%C3%B3n)** (1882-1955): An innovator of guitar technique.
- **Rosendo Ruiz** (1885-1983): Author of guitar methods that shaped generations.

The tradition continued with figures like [María Teresa Vera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Teresa_Vera), [Compay Segundo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compay_Segundo), and [Eliades Ochoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliades_Ochoa), taking Cuban trova to international stages.

## Casa de la Trova: Temple of Santiago's Music

In the heart of Santiago de Cuba, the **Casa de la Trova** is the epicenter of this festival. Founded in honor of Pepe Sánchez, this intimate space has hosted countless jam sessions where veteran and young trovadores share the stage.

During the festival, the Casa de la Trova vibrates with concerts that begin at noon and extend until dawn. It's here where you can hear trova in its purest form: intimate, without excessive amplification, just as the 19th-century troubadours sang it.

## What to Expect from the 2026 Festival

This year's edition promises:

- **Concerts at Casa de la Trova** featuring trovadores from across Cuba
- **Performances at Teatro Heredia** and public plazas
- **"The Troubadour Trail"**: a tour of historic sites including the graves of legendary trovadores at Santa Ifigenia cemetery
- **Special tributes** on the anniversary of Pepe Sánchez's birth (March 19)
- **Workshops and lectures** on trova history and technique

## Why Trova Matters Today

In an era of reggaeton and urban music, trova might seem anachronistic. But its essence—telling stories honestly, accompanied only by a guitar—continues to resonate.

Young Cuban trovadores of the 21st century carry on the tradition, adapting it without betraying it. Singer-songwriters like [Buena Fe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Fe_(band)) or Kelvis Ochoa prove that trova has a future.

The Pepe Sánchez Festival isn't just nostalgia. It's a celebration of a living art that continues to evolve, faithful to the spirit of that Santiago tailor who 143 years ago composed a song called "Tristezas" and, without knowing it, created a genre.
