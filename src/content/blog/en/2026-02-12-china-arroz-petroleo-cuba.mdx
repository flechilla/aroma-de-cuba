China reaffirmed its political support for Cuba on Wednesday amid the energy crisis, but carefully avoided committing to oil shipments, deferring any fuel assistance to vague "bilateral consultations."

## Rice Yes, Oil... We'll See

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian declared that Beijing "firmly supports Cuba in safeguarding its sovereignty" and "resolutely opposes inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence."

However, when asked directly about fuel shipments, Lin dodged the question. "The specific content of any cooperation must be consulted with competent authorities and addressed through bilateral channels," he said.

## What Has Actually Arrived

In recent weeks, China has announced:

- **90,000 tons of rice** shipped to Cuba
- **$80 million** in "emergency financial assistance"
- Plus the **$100 million** granted in 2024

Foreign Minister Wang Yi also expressed his "opposition to interference by external forces" during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez in Beijing.

## The Trump Factor

The statements come as Cuba faces its worst energy crisis in decades. In January, President Trump signed an [executive order](/en/blog/2026-02-11-guiteras-fuera-servicio-deficit-2000-mw/) authorizing 25% tariffs on any country that ships oil to the island.

Mexico has already [suspended its crude shipments](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-corta-envios-petroleo-cuba-primera-vez-decada/), and neither Russia nor China has confirmed willingness to challenge U.S. sanctions with fuel deliveries.

## Silence Speaks Louder Than Words

The contrast is telling: while China publicly announces food shipments, the oil question gets buried in bureaucratic language. It's a signal that even Havana's closest allies are calculating the costs of confronting Washington.

Cuba, which [lost Venezuelan supply](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-medidas-emergencia-universidades-hospitales/) after the U.S. intervention in Caracas, finds itself increasingly isolated in its search for fuel.
