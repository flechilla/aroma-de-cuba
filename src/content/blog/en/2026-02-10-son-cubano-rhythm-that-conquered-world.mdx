When the tres guitar sounds, the maracas mark the rhythm, and a weathered voice sings of love and longing, you're listening to **son cubano** — the musical heartbeat of a nation.

## Origins: From Oriente to the World

Son was born in the **mountains of Cuba's eastern region** in the late 19th century, fusing African traditions with the Spanish guitar. Workers from sugarcane fields and ports carried it with them, and by the 1920s it had conquered Havana.

What began as music from humble neighborhoods soon became the sound of all Cuba. The **Sexteto Habanero** and **Trío Matamoros** were pioneers in bringing it to recording studios.

## Instruments of the Soul

Son is recognized by its unique instrumentation:

- **The tres** — guitar with three pairs of strings, the melodic heart
- **Maracas** — the constant pulse
- **Bongos** — the dialogue of the drums
- **Double bass** — the deep foundation
- **Claves** — the rhythmic pattern that ties everything together
- **Trumpet** — added later, gave it its urban character

## From Fathers to Sons: The Legends

### Compay Segundo (1907-2003)
Francisco Repilado created the "armónico," a seven-string guitar. His "Chan Chan" is perhaps the most recognizable Cuban song in the world.

### Ibrahim Ferrer (1927-2005)
"The King of Bolero" lived almost forgotten until Buena Vista Social Club rescued him at 70. He won a Grammy without ever having dreamed of stepping onto an international stage.

### Omara Portuondo (1930-)
"The Bride of Filin," still active at 95, represents the elegance and passion of son sung by women.

## The Buena Vista Social Club Miracle

In 1996, producer Ry Cooder and musician Juan de Marcos González gathered son veterans who lived almost forgotten. **In just seven days** they recorded an album that would sell over 8 million copies and win a Grammy.

Wim Wenders' documentary (1999) brought their faces and stories to the entire world. Suddenly, musicians in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s were playing at Carnegie Hall.

> "I never thought at my age I would get to see the world." — Ibrahim Ferrer

## Son Today

The legacy continues. In 2025, **the Buena Vista story came to Broadway**, presenting the power of this music to new generations.

Son evolved into **salsa** in New York, **timba** in Cuba, but its essence remains: that montuno that forces your feet to move, that clave rhythm you carry in your blood if you were born Cuban.

*You don't learn son, you carry it inside. And if you don't carry it, it finds you.*
