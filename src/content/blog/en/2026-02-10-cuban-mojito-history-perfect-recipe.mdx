  - question: "What rum is used for mojitos?"

  - question: "What's the difference between a mojito and caipirinha?"
    answer: "The mojito uses rum and spearmint, while the Brazilian caipirinha uses cachaça and lime. The mojito is more refreshing and herbal; the caipirinha more citrusy and intense."

"My mojito in La Bodeguita, my daiquirí in El Floridita." This phrase, attributed to Ernest Hemingway, immortalized the **mojito** as Cuba's quintessential cocktail. But its history begins long before the famous writer.

## Origins of the Mojito

### The Legend of El Draque

The mojito's ancestor was called **"El Draque"**, named after English pirate Sir Francis Drake. In the 16th century, sailors mixed cane spirit with lime, sugar, and mint to fight scurvy and make the raw alcohol more tolerable.

### From Draque to Mojito

When Cuba began producing quality **rum** in the 19th century, the rough spirit was replaced and the modern mojito was born. The name comes from the African term "mojo" (small spell) — and this cocktail certainly casts a spell.

## La Bodeguita del Medio

This small bar in Old Havana, founded in 1942, became the **temple of the mojito**. Its walls covered with signatures from celebrities — from Hemingway to Gabriel García Márquez — bear witness to decades of history.

> Address: Empedrado 207, between Cuba and San Ignacio, Old Havana.

## The Perfect Recipe

### Ingredients (1 mojito)
- 60 ml white Cuban rum (Havana Club 3 Years ideal)
- 30 ml fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 6-8 fresh spearmint leaves
- Soda water
- Ice

### Preparation

1. **Muddle gently:** In the glass, place the mint leaves and sugar. Muddle *gently* with a muddler. The goal is to release the essential oils, NOT destroy the leaves.

2. **The lime:** Add fresh lime juice. Never use bottled lime juice.

3. **The rum:** Pour in the white rum and mix well to dissolve the sugar.

4. **The ice:** Fill the glass with crushed ice or ice cubes.

5. **The finishing touch:** Top with soda water and stir gently. Garnish with a sprig of mint and a lime wheel.

## Secrets from Cuban Bartenders

### The Mint
Use **spearmint** (Mentha nemorosa), not common mint. The difference is subtle but important — spearmint is softer and more aromatic.

### The Muddling
The most common mistake is muddling too hard. This makes the leaves bitter. You only need enough pressure to release the oils.

### The Sugar
Traditional white sugar is part of the authentic flavor. Simple syrup is easier to mix but slightly changes the result.

### The Rum
Quality white rum is essential. Havana Club 3 Years is the Cuban standard, but Santiago de Cuba Carta Blanca also works very well.

## Popular Variations

- **Strawberry Mojito:** Add muddled strawberries
- **Passion Fruit Mojito:** With passion fruit pulp
- **Aged Rum Mojito:** Deeper and more complex
- **Nojito:** Non-alcoholic version with ginger ale

## The Mojito Today

Although the mojito has conquered the world, in Cuba it remains a drink of celebration — at parties, family gatherings, and of course, in the bars of Old Havana where tradition continues.
