The first deportation flight of Cuban citizens from the United States to Cuba in 2026 landed on Monday, February 9 at **José Martí International Airport** in Havana, marking the restart of repatriations after the beginning of the new year.

## Flight numbers

The plane transported **170 Cuban migrants** who had been detained at various points in US territory for being in an irregular immigration situation:

- **153 men**
- **17 women**
- **3 people** remained under investigation for alleged criminal conduct prior to their emigration

The deportees were received by Cuban authorities upon arrival of the aircraft, following protocols established in bilateral migration agreements.

## Deportation context

This operation represents the first deportation flight carried out in 2026, resuming a flow of repatriations that began in 2023 after a prolonged interruption. Since then, dozens of similar flights have been carried out under strict operational parameters.

The repatriation of Cubans is regulated by a migration cooperation scheme that provides for procedures for the return of people who enter or remain in US territory without the required documentation.

## Bilateral tensions

The forced return of Cuban citizens comes at a time of continued political tensions between Washington and Havana. Migration issues are added to the [energy disputes](/en/blog/guiteras-crisis-energetica-deficit-record/) and regional security matters that mark the bilateral agenda.

US officials have noted that management of irregular migration and orderly repatriation are key elements of border control policy, especially given the increase in arrivals via irregular routes from the Caribbean.

## Impact on the diaspora

For the Cuban community in the United States, each deportation flight represents a reminder of the immigration precarity faced by thousands of compatriots. Deportations affect not only the repatriated but their families who remain divided between both countries.
