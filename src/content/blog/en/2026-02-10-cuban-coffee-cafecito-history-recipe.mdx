faq:
  - question: "What makes Cuban coffee different from regular espresso?"
    answer: "Cuban coffee is distinguished by its espuma (foam), a sweet cream made by whipping sugar with the first drops of coffee. This technique creates a creamy texture and sweeter taste than traditional espresso."
  - question: "What type of coffee maker is used to make Cuban coffee?"
    answer: "Traditionally, a moka pot (called 'greca' in Cuba) is used—an Italian stovetop coffee maker. Espresso machines can also be used, though purists prefer the moka for its more intense flavor."
  - question: "What's the difference between cafecito, cortadito, and café con leche?"
    answer: "Cafecito is a small sweet espresso shot. Cortadito is espresso with hot evaporated milk (50/50 to 75/25 ratio). Café con leche is espresso served alongside hot milk, typical of Cuban breakfast."
  - question: "Why are Cuban coffee plantations a World Heritage Site?"
    answer: "UNESCO declared the Archaeological Landscape of the First Coffee Plantations in Southeast Cuba a World Heritage Site in 2000, recognizing 171 historic coffee estates founded by French colonists who fled Haiti in the early 19th century."

The aroma of Cuban coffee is unmistakable. That first sip—intense and sweet, crowned by a golden foam that seems to float atop the dark liquid—is more than a beverage: it's a ritual that defines Cuban identity, both on the island and in every corner of the world where a Cuban heart beats.

## A History that Began in Haiti

The story of coffee in Cuba has an unexpected origin. In the early 19th century, French colonists fleeing the [Haitian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution) arrived on Cuba's eastern shores with their knowledge of coffee cultivation. They found perfect conditions in the **Sierra Maestra** mountains: altitude between 500 and 800 meters, cool and humid climate, and fertile soils that rivaled the best coffee-growing terrain in the Caribbean.

These pioneers established more than **171 coffee estates** in the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo. Their innovative techniques and distinctive plantation architecture were so significant that in 2000, [UNESCO declared this coffee landscape a World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1008/), recognizing it as an exceptional testimony to a form of cultivation that transformed Cuban economy and society.

## The Art of the Foam: La Espumita

What distinguishes Cuban coffee from any other espresso in the world is its **espuma** (also called *espumita* or *crema*). It's not simply coffee with sugar: it's alchemy.

### How to Create the Perfect Foam

1. **The first stream**: When coffee begins to flow from the moka pot, the first drops are the most concentrated and hot. These are immediately poured over the sugar.

2. **Vigorous beating**: Using a spoon, the sugar is beaten with those first drops until a creamy, light brown paste forms. This process can take 3 to 5 minutes of constant beating.

3. **The fusion**: Once the coffee finishes brewing, it's poured over the beaten foam. The coffee's heat completely dissolves the sucrose, creating a sweeter and more viscous beverage than any conventionally sweetened coffee.

The secret lies in temperature: the direct heat from the extraction process allows the sugar to integrate differently, resulting in a velvety texture impossible to replicate by adding sugar afterward.

## The Four Faces of Cuban Coffee

### Cafecito (Cuban Coffee)
The purest expression: a small shot of sweet espresso with its characteristic foam. Served in demitasse cups, it's the fuel that powers Cuban conversation.

### Colada
Between 3 and 6 shots of cafecito served in a styrofoam cup, accompanied by small plastic cups. It's the social version of coffee, designed for sharing at work or among friends. The colada is pure communal ritual.

### Cortadito
Sweet espresso "cut" with hot evaporated milk. The ratio varies between 50/50 and 75/25 coffee to milk. Unlike the Spanish cortado, the Cuban version always comes pre-sweetened with espuma.

### Café con Leche
The quintessential Cuban breakfast. Espresso is served in one cup and hot milk in another, allowing each person to adjust the proportion according to their preference. Traditionally accompanied by **Cuban bread toast** spread with butter.

## Miami's Ventanitas

If Cuba is the birthplace of cafecito, Miami is its second home. In Little Havana and other Cuban-American communities, **ventanitas**—small windows in cafés and restaurants—dispense Cuban coffee at any hour of the day.

These ventanitas are much more than points of sale: they're social centers where the community gathers, exchanges news, and keeps the Cuban spirit alive. The ritual of ordering a cafecito at a ventanita is a complete sensory experience: the hiss of the espresso machine, the aroma escaping through the window, the clatter of small cups, and the animated conversations floating in Florida's tropical air.

## The Brands that Define the Flavor

While any dark-roast espresso can be used, three brands dominate the Cuban and Cuban-American market:

- **[Café Bustelo](https://www.cafebustelo.com/)**: Founded in 1928 by a Spanish immigrant in New York, it has become synonymous with Cuban coffee in the United States.
- **Café La Llave**: "The key to good coffee," with its dark roast and intense flavor.
- **Café Pilón**: Another iconic brand found in virtually every Cuban household.

## Recipe: Authentic Cuban Coffee at Home

**Ingredients:**
- 2-3 tablespoons espresso-ground coffee (dark roast)
- 3-4 teaspoons sugar
- Water

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the moka pot**: Fill the lower chamber with water up to the valve. Add coffee to the filter without pressing too hard.

2. **Prepare the sugar bowl**: In a small cup or metal container, place the sugar.

3. **Capture the first stream**: When coffee begins to emerge, quickly pour the first drops (approximately one tablespoon) over the sugar.

4. **Beat with energy**: Use a small spoon to vigorously beat the sugar and coffee until forming a creamy, light brown paste. This step is crucial.

5. **Complete the coffee**: Once the moka pot finishes brewing, pour the rest of the coffee over the beaten foam and mix gently.

6. **Serve immediately**: Cafecito is enjoyed hot, in small cups.

## More Than a Beverage

Cuban coffee transcends its function as a mere stimulant. It's the excuse for conversation, the fuel for dominos in the park, the gesture of hospitality toward visitors, the moment of pause amid daily bustle.

In every cup of cafecito, there's a story connecting the mountains of the Sierra Maestra with the streets of Miami, the estates of Santiago with diaspora kitchens. It's small but powerful, sweet but intense—just like Cuba itself.
