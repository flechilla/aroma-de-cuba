In the world of classical ballet, few names shine as brightly as **Carlos Acosta**. The legendary Havana-born dancer, who conquered the most prestigious stages on the planet, is now transforming the most beloved holiday classic with his production *Nutcracker in Havana*—an explosion of color, rhythm, and Cuban soul that is captivating British audiences.

## From Havana's Poorest Streets to World Stages

Carlos Acosta's story is the Cuban dream made real. Born on June 2, 1973, in one of Havana's humblest neighborhoods, he was the eleventh and last child of Pedro Acosta, a truck driver, and Dulce María Quesada. He grew up without toys, sometimes without shoes, and didn't taste a birthday cake until he was 23.

> "My father sent me to ballet school so I would have discipline and a free lunch every day," Acosta recalls.

What began as a practical solution from a worried father became the birth of a legend. At the [Cuban National Ballet School](https://www.balletcuba.cu/), under the guidance of teachers like Ramona de Sáa, young Carlos discovered an exceptional gift that would lead him to win the prestigious [Prix de Lausanne](https://www.prixdelausanne.org/) in 1990.

## The Nutcracker Cuba Never Had

What makes *Nutcracker in Havana* so special? The answer lies in Cuba's own history. From 1969 to 1998, Christmas was officially banned on the island. Carlos Acosta never grew up with the Christmas traditions that Tchaikovsky's *Nutcracker* celebrates in its traditional version.

"I wanted to create the *Nutcracker* I would have loved to see as a child," Acosta explains. And did he ever succeed.

### A Dreamlike Havana

Instead of a snow-covered Victorian mansion, the action unfolds in a humble Cuban house with a thatched palm roof. Clara becomes Lara, a mischievous girl from Havana. The mysterious Drosselmeyer is now **Tío Elías**, returning from Miami with magical gifts. And the Nutcracker isn't a European soldier, but a **mambí**—a Cuban independence soldier.

Nina Dunn's sets transport audiences through the streets of Havana with cinematic projections that have left audiences "spellbound," according to British reviews.

## Tchaikovsky with a Son Cubano Beat

Composer Pepe Gavilondo Peón has done a masterful job "Cubanizing" Tchaikovsky's score. The original melodies remain recognizable, but the rhythms transform with touches of [Cuban son](/en/blog/cuban-son-history/), Caribbean trumpets, and guitars that make it impossible to keep your feet still.

British critics are fascinated:

> "It was magic. There was magic. Acosta is a magician. It had been forecast to snow in Edinburgh, but inside the Festival Theatre, man, it was hot, hot, hot!"  
> — *The QR Review*, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The fusion isn't just musical. Acosta's choreography interweaves classical ballet with Afro-Cuban movements, including the traditional chancleta clog dance and conga elements. The more than twenty dancers from **Acosta Danza** transition fluidly between impeccable pirouettes and rhythmic Afro-Cuban undulations.

## A Company with a Mission

[Acosta Danza](https://www.carlosacosta.com/), the company Carlos founded in Havana, represents his commitment to giving back to Cuba what ballet gave him. Young Cuban dancers now have opportunities to perform in the world's finest theaters.

"I want dance to be for the many, not just the few," states Acosta, who has also directed the [Birmingham Royal Ballet](https://www.brb.org.uk/) since 2020.

Angelo Alberto's costumes complement the vision with colorful, exotic, and quirky outfits in all the right places. From the Rat King's tail to the Arabian dancers' costumes and the Sugar Plum Fairies, every visual element celebrates Cuba's aesthetic richness.

## The Legacy Continues

At 52, Carlos Acosta has received the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to ballet, has been compared to [Mikhail Baryshnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Baryshnikov) and [Rudolf Nureyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Nureyev), and continues to reinvent himself.

*Nutcracker in Havana* is more than a show; it's a love letter to the Cuba that shaped Acosta, proof that ballet can speak with a Cuban accent, and evidence that the most unlikely dreams sometimes come true on the streets of Havana.
