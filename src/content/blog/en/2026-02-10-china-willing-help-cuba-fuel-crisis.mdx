In a new development in Cuba's ongoing energy crisis, **China has expressed its willingness to provide aid to the Caribbean island** as the country faces a severe aviation fuel shortage.

## Official Statement from Beijing

During a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson **Lin Jian** announced his government's official position:

> "China firmly supports Cuba in safeguarding its national sovereignty and security, and opposes foreign interference. We will always provide support and help to the Cuban side to the best of our ability."

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-willing-help-cuba-amid-jet-fuel-shortage-foreign-ministry-says-2026-02-10/), the Chinese government also confirmed there have been no reports of Chinese citizens stranded in Cuba due to flight suspensions by various international airlines.

## Crisis Context

China's declaration comes at a critical moment for Cuba:

- **Flight suspensions:** [Air Canada has cancelled all flights](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights) until May, affecting thousands of tourists
- **No oil:** [Mexico has halted shipments](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade) for the first time in a decade amid US tariff threats
- **Emergency measures:** [The Cuban government has implemented](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals) a 4-day work week and closed universities

## International Support

China joins [Russia, which has also described the situation as "critical"](/en/blog/2026-02-10-russia-declares-cuba-situation-critical-accuses-us) and accused the United States of "suffocating" the island. Both powers maintain historic relations with Cuba and have expressed their rejection of US sanctions.

However, the Chinese statement does not specify what concrete assistance Beijing will provide. Options could include:

- Oil or fuel shipments
- Humanitarian aid (food, medicine)
- Technical assistance
- Financial support

## Geopolitical Implications

China's offer of help adds a new geopolitical dimension to the Cuban crisis. As the Trump administration intensifies pressure on the island, powers like China and Russia are positioning themselves as allies willing to counter the isolation imposed by Washington.

For Cuba, Beijing's support could represent a crucial lifeline amid what many compare to a new "Special Period" — though China's capacity and speed of response to such an acute crisis remains to be seen.
