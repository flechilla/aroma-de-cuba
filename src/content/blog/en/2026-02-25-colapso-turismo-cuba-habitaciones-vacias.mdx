  - question: "How many tourists visited Cuba in 2025?"
    answer: "According to official ONEI figures, Cuba received only 1.8 million visitors in 2025, an 18% decrease from the previous year and the lowest level in 13 years (excluding the pandemic)."
  - question: "Why have so many flights to the island been suspended?"
    answer: "The Jet A1 fuel crisis has forced Canadian and Russian airlines to suspend routes following announcements of a lack of supply for refueling at Cuban airports."
  - question: "What is the financial impact of this decline?"
    answer: "Tourism is the country's primary source of foreign exchange. Its paralysis prevents the government from importing food, medicine, and supplies for the electrical system, worsening the crisis cycle."
  - question: "How are international hotel chains reacting?"
    answer: "Giants like NH have closed all operations on the island, while Meliá has begun 'compacting' services and temporarily closing facilities due to low occupancy, which is below 30%."

Old Havana, the once-beating heart of international tourism in Cuba, today looks like a ghost town. February 25, 2026, marks a grim turning point: the tourism industry, the island's primary foreign currency lifeline, is on the verge of total paralysis due to a perfect storm of energy blockade and crumbling infrastructure.

## \"Everything Looks Dead\"

Recent reports from international media such as the BBC and testimonies from entrepreneurs on the ground describe a capital where luxury hotels remain dark and rooms empty. In the informal market, the price of gasoline for rental cars has reached **10 USD per liter**, a prohibitive cost that has paralyzed classic tourist circuits to Viñales or Trinidad.

The drastic drop in visitor arrivals—barely **1.8 million people** in 2025—has hit not only state coffers but also the more than 300,000 self-employed workers who depend on foreign consumption and tips.

## The Final Blow: Aviation Fuel Crisis

The announcement of a critical shortage of **Jet A1** fuel was the final trigger. The mass repatriation of Canadian and Russian tourists in early February left a void that the peak season has failed to fill. Without stable direct flights, the flow of fresh dollars has almost completely stopped.

\"Before I left, there were weeks with a maximum of five customers,\" says a barista who recently fled the country. \"Without tourists, there are no dollars; and without dollars, the country literally shuts down.\"

## Failed Investment in Luxury Hotels

While the National Electric System (SEN) collapses due to lack of maintenance, the Cuban government continued to prioritize the construction of high-end hotels through GAESA. Today, these structures face occupancy levels below 30%, becoming \"white elephants\" in the middle of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

### Visitor Comparison (High Season):
*   **2018 (Record):** 4.7 million visitors.
*   **2023:** 2.4 million visitors.
*   **2025:** 1.8 million visitors.
