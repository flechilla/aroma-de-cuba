Mexico has completely halted oil shipments to Cuba, leaving the island without Mexican crude for the first time in a decade. The decision comes in response to President Donald Trump's threats to impose 30% tariffs on any country supplying oil to Cuba.

## A Historic Decision

President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed Sunday that oil shipments are currently frozen as her government seeks to support Cuba without triggering reprisals from Washington.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/mexican-oil-shipments-cuba-currently-halted-president-says-2026-02-09/), Mexico was Cuba's largest supplier after Venezuelan shipments ceased in December following the U.S. blockade.

## From 22,000 to Zero Barrels

Mexico had been sending approximately 22,000 barrels per day to Cuba, though that figure dropped to about 7,000 toward the end of 2025, according to Jorge Piñón, a University of Texas oil expert cited by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/americas/mexico-cuba-oil.html).

Now, for the first time in ten years, Cuba has logged a full month without oil imports, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/cuba-gets-no-oil-for-first-time-in-a-decade-as-mexico-pulls-back).

## Sheinbaum Promises to Seek Alternatives

Despite halting oil shipments, the Mexican president has reiterated her solidarity with Cuba and announced that humanitarian aid shipments will continue.

"Mexico is always supportive and cannot ignore the sanctions against Cuba," Sheinbaum declared, adding that "such sanctions are wrong because they leave them without fuel for their activities, and the people suffer."
