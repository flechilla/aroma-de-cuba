The recent release of a 25-year-old Cuban man, after spending nearly 80 days in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has provided a ray of hope but also raised multiple questions within the Cuban community in the United States. This case highlights the vulnerability of those holding Form **I-220A** (Order of Release on Recognizance) and the complex landscape they face under the current administration.

The young man, identified as Daniel, was transferred through several detention centers in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida before gaining his freedom on bail. His case is emblematic because Daniel had no criminal record, highlighting the shift in focus regarding detention and deportation priorities.

## The I-220A Limbo

For thousands of Cubans, Form I-220A represents a critical obstacle to obtaining permanent residency through the **Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA)**. Unlike *parole*, the I-220A is not currently uniformly recognized by courts as a legal admission, leaving some 500,000 migrants in a prolonged legal "limbo."

This incident occurs just days after new deportation flights to Havana were reported and following the key hearing at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami, where the validity of this very document is being discussed.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. Why does ICE detain people with I-220A despite having no record?**  
Under the new 2026 immigration guidelines, ICE's discretion has been broadened, allowing for the detention of individuals even without a criminal history while their asylum or removal processes are pending.

**2. How did Daniel manage to get released?**  
Through a vigorous legal defense that requested a bond hearing, demonstrating that he did not represent a danger to the community or a flight risk, resulting in an immigration judge approving his release.

**3. Does this release signal a general policy change?**  
Not necessarily. Each case depends on the decisions of individual judges and the specific circumstances of the asylum seeker.

**4. What should those with I-220A who fear detention do?**  
Immigration lawyers recommend keeping supervision appointments up to date, having an active asylum application, and securing legal representation ready to act in case of an unforeseen detention.
