Some desserts transcend the kitchen and become memory itself. **Casquitos de guayaba** — halved guavas slowly cooked in fragrant syrup with cinnamon and cloves, served alongside generous slices of cream cheese — are exactly that. One bite contains all the sweetness of the Cuban tropics.

## Guava: Cuba's queen fruit

The [guava (*Psidium guajava*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psidium_guajava) is one of Cuba's most abundant and beloved fruits. It grows wild in fields and backyards, perfuming the air with its unmistakable aroma when ripe. The Taíno people consumed it long before the Spanish arrived, and it has since become essential to [Cuban pastry traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_cuisine).

From guava comes **pasta de guayaba** (the firm paste served with cheese), marmalade, the famous [guava pastries](/en/blog/2026-02-12-pastelitos-de-guayaba-cubanos/), and of course, casquitos — the simplest and perhaps most perfect guava dessert of all.

## Traditional casquitos de guayaba recipe

### Ingredients (serves 4)

- **500 g pink guavas**, ripe but firm
- **1½ cups sugar** (300 g)
- **3 cups water**
- **1 cinnamon stick**
- **3 whole cloves**
- **Zest of half a lemon**
- **Pinch of salt**
- **Cream cheese** for serving

### Instructions

1. **Peel and clean:** Peel the guavas with a vegetable peeler. Cut in half and scoop out the seeds with a small spoon, leaving hollow shells. Save the seeds — strain them to make juice.

2. **Initial cooking:** Place the shells in a medium pot with 3 cups of water. Cook on high heat for 20 minutes until they begin to soften.

3. **The syrup:** Add the sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, lemon zest, and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring gently, for 40-50 minutes. The syrup should thicken and the shells turn a deep ruby red.

4. **The right moment:** The casquitos are ready when a fork slides through easily and the syrup coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and let cool in the pot.

5. **Serve:** Present the shells bathed in syrup alongside slices of cream cheese. Cuban tradition dictates that the cheese is never optional.

### Grandmother's tips

- **Don't stir roughly** — the shells break easily. Instead, swirl the pot in gentle circular motions.
- **Salt is the secret:** That pinch of salt enhances all the sweetness without being noticed.
- **Never use green guavas:** They stay hard and bitter. Look for ones that yield slightly to pressure and smell intensely fragrant.
- For a darker, deeper syrup, substitute part of the white sugar with [turbinado or muscovado sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovado).

## Guava and cheese: the perfect marriage

In Cuba, we say guava and cheese are **married**. This pairing appears across the island: in [pastelitos](/en/blog/2026-02-12-pastelitos-de-guayaba-cubanos/), in bars of guava paste sliced beside white country cheese, and in these shells with their cream cheese.

Science explains it: the fat in the cheese softens the guava's acidity while the syrup's sweetness contrasts with the saltiness. But Cubans need no explanation — it simply *works*.

## Modern variations

Casquitos de guayaba have been reimagined in kitchens from Miami to Havana:

- **Shells stuffed with cream cheese** and briefly baked
- **Over vanilla ice cream** — warm syrup against cold ice cream
- **With Greek yogurt** for a tropical breakfast
- **Syrup reduction** as a glaze for pork dishes, like [Cuban roast pork](/en/blog/2026-02-11-lechon-asado-cubano/)

## A dessert of patience and love

Casquitos de guayaba cannot be rushed. They require low heat, constant attention, and the willingness to let time do its work. Perhaps that's why they taste like home, like a Sunday afternoon, like a Cuban grandmother's kitchen where the best things in life are cooked slowly.

If you can find fresh guavas, there's no excuse not to try. And if you can only find canned guavas, it works too — though Cubans will look at you with a certain pity. The cream cheese, however, is non-negotiable.
