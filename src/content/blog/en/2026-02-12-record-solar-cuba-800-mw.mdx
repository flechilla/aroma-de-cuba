faq:
  - question: "How many megawatts of solar energy does Cuba currently generate?"
    answer: "Cuba reached a record 800 MW of solar generation at midday on February 11, 2026. The country has over 1,000 MW of installed photovoltaic capacity."
  - question: "How many solar farms does Cuba have in operation?"
    answer: "Cuba has 49 solar photovoltaic parks in operation as of February 2026, though the original plan called for 55 parks by the end of 2025."
  - question: "What is Cuba's solar energy goal for 2026?"
    answer: "Cuba plans to reach 2,000 MW of solar capacity by the end of 2026, doubling its current capacity as part of its energy independence strategy."

Amid the worst energy crisis Cuba has faced in decades, the island achieved a hopeful milestone: **solar farms exceeded 800 MW of generation at midday on Tuesday**, setting a new national record for photovoltaic energy.

## A Ray of Light in the Darkness

The record was announced by engineer **Félix Estrada Rodríguez**, director of the National Load Dispatch of the [Unión Eléctrica](https://www.une.cu/), who attributed the achievement to the accelerated expansion of installed capacity in the country.

> "The country installed more than 1,000 MW in this clean energy modality in 2025"

Cuba currently has **49 solar parks in operation**, although the original plan projected having 55 running by the end of last year. The goal for 2026 is ambitious: reach **2,000 MW of solar capacity**.

## The Effort Behind the Numbers

The solar expansion hasn't been easy. According to Deputy Minister of Construction **Antonio Mauri Medina**, each 21.8 MW park requires:

- **42,588 solar panels**
- **16,380 piles**
- Hundreds of specialized workers

In total, **15,000 workers** from multiple sectors have been mobilized to install these solar farms at a forced pace.

## Storage: The Next Frontier

To take advantage of surplus solar generation, Cuba began installing its first **Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)** in the municipality of Cueto, Holguín. These 50 MW batteries will allow:

- Storing energy for peak consumption hours
- Stabilizing the system during thermoelectric plant failures
- Reducing dependence on imported fuel

The plan includes installing similar systems at strategic substations like Bayamo 220, Cotorro 220, and Habana 220.

## China Drives the Transformation

Deputy Prime Minister **Óscar Pérez-Oliva Fraga** confirmed that the solar park program is sponsored by China, and that this is "the country's first decision" to face the crisis:

> "That is the path, that is where we need to get to"

## The Context: An Island Without Oil

The solar record comes as Cuba faces [blackouts exceeding 20 hours](/en/blog/2026-02-11-guiteras-fuera-servicio-deficit-2000-mw/) across most of the country. Since the United States [cut off Venezuelan oil supply](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-corta-envios-petroleo-cuba-primera-vez-decada/) after the capture of Nicolás Maduro on January 3, the island lost the 30,000 barrels per day it received from Venezuela.

The bet on solar energy represents Cuba's hope of achieving some energy independence, although experts warn that photovoltaic generation drops drastically on cloudy days—up to 90% during storms—limiting its effectiveness as the only solution.
