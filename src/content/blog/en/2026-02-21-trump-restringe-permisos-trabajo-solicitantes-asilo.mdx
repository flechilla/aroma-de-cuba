The Trump administration proposed on February 20 a measure that would **drastically restrict work permits** for asylum seekers in the United States, a decision that will directly affect thousands of Cubans with pending cases.

## What Does the New Rule Propose?

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [announced the proposal](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/02/20/dhs-proposes-rule-prioritize-americans-safety-strengthening-screening-asylum) with two major changes:

- **365-day wait**: Asylum seekers will need to wait a full year before applying for a work permit, doubling the current 180-day period.
- **Indefinite pause**: When the average processing time at USCIS exceeds 180 days, acceptance of new work permit applications will be suspended. This pause could last **for years**.

"For too long, a fraudulent asylum claim has been an easy way to work in the United States," a DHS spokesperson stated.

## Direct Impact on the Cuban Community

The measure arrives at a particularly difficult time for Cuban migrants. With over **1.4 million asylum applications** pending before USCIS, the system already faces monumental delays.

For Cubans who arrived in the U.S. in recent years—many through the CHNV program or crossing the border—**losing access to work permits means being stuck in economic limbo** while awaiting the resolution of their asylum cases.

Immigration attorney Willy Allen called the proposal "another cruel effort by this government to humiliate and create more anxiety within the immigrant community," warning that the measure "will only create suffering and will not alleviate the asylum review process at all."

## An Ever-Tightening Noose

This restriction adds to a series of measures that have progressively hardened conditions for Cuban migrants in 2026:

- **[302 Cubans deported](/en/blog/2026-02-20-segundo-vuelo-deportacion-cuba-116-migrantes-2026)** in the first two months of the year
- **[Cuba accepting deportees with serious criminal records](/en/blog/2026-02-19-cuba-acepta-deportados-delitos-graves-primera-vez)** for the first time
- **[Nicaragua closing the migration route](/en/blog/2026-02-16-nicaragua-visa-128-paises-cubanos)** by requiring visas from 128 countries
- **[ICE detention bed expansion](/en/blog/2026-02-15-ice-expansion-92000-camas-dhs-cierre)** to 92,600

## 60 Days of Public Comment

The proposal will be open for public comments for the next 60 days before a final decision. However, analysts warn that the Trump administration has shown little willingness to modify its immigration policies based on public feedback.

For Cubans with pending asylum applications, attorneys recommend:

1. **Apply for work permits now** if you already meet current requirements
2. **Consult an immigration attorney** to evaluate options before the rule takes effect
3. **Review your case status** and any pending deadlines

The work permit restriction represents another blow to the already complicated immigration landscape for Cubans in the United States, who simultaneously face [increased deportations](/en/blog/2026-02-17-drama-cubanos-deportados-eeuu-testimonios), closed migration routes, and tightened asylum processes.
