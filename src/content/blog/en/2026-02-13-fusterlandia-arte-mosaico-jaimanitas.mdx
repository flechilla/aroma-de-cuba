In the modest fishing village of **Jaimanitas**, just 20 minutes west of downtown Havana, there's a place that looks like a technicolor dream. It's called **Fusterlandia**, and it's the living masterpiece of Cuban artist **José Fuster**.

## From a Doorway to an Entire Neighborhood

It all started in **1994**, when Fuster decided to decorate the entrance to his house with ceramic mosaics. What began as a personal project became a transformative obsession. From the doorway to the patio, from the patio to the facade, and from his house to the entire neighborhood.

Today, more than **80 houses, bus stops, benches, and public buildings** in Jaimanitas are covered in mosaics, sculptures, and ceramic murals in an explosion of color unmatched anywhere in the Caribbean.

> "People think of Gaudí because of the technique, but the concept is Brâncuși." — José Fuster

## The Artist Behind the Magic

José Fuster was born in **1946 in Caibarién**, in central Cuba. Before Fusterlandia, he was already an acclaimed painter, engraver, and ceramist. But traditional formats felt too small.

In **1976**, he visited [Târgu Jiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2rgu_Jiu) in Romania, where sculptor **Constantin Brâncuși** had created a monumental complex integrating art and public space. That experience planted a seed that would take nearly two decades to bloom.

At 79, Fuster keeps working. He gets around the neighborhood in an electric cart and finances everything through his painting sales, without government support.

## A Cuban Visual Universe

Fuster's art is **naïve**: primitive shapes, bright colors, free compositions. But it's deeply Cuban:

- **Royal palms** and **roosters** appear on every corner
- Figures of **guajiros** (peasants) populate the murals
- Popular sayings and poetic verses weave between the images
- References to the **1959 Revolution** and Cuban history emerge among pink elephants and mermaids

The centerpiece is his **studio-workshop**, which doubles as a museum. Highlights include the **"Cuban Table"**, a tribute to iconic figures from the country's history, and the **"Rooster Tower"**, a four-meter structure covered in multicolored tiles.

## Inevitable Comparisons

Fuster is constantly compared to [Antoni Gaudí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) for his use of the **trencadís** technique (mosaic made from ceramic fragments). He's also been called the **"Cuban Picasso"** for his free, expressive style.

But Fuster insists his true inspiration is **Brâncuși**: not just decorating, but transforming an entire place into a work of art. And where Brâncuși was sober, Fuster is baroque, tropical, overflowing — as Cuban as café con leche.

## Community Impact

What's remarkable about Fusterlandia isn't just the art — it's the **social transformation**. Many homes in Jaimanitas were wooden and deteriorating. Fuster rebuilt them in cement and covered them in mosaics, improving his neighbors' quality of life.

Jorge González, known as "El Mexicano," age 79, says he lives "in a work of art." During the brief diplomatic thaw between the United States and Cuba, celebrities like **Madonna** and **Sean Penn** paraded past his door.

The name "Fusterlandia" was coined by an American journalist, and it stuck forever.

## Visiting Fusterlandia

Each week, about **a thousand tourists** visit Jaimanitas to explore this open-air museum. There's no formal entrance: you walk the streets and discover art around every corner.

**How to get there:** From central Havana, about 20 minutes by taxi heading west, near Marina Hemingway.

**Hours:** Fuster's studio-workshop is open during the day. With luck, you might see the artist at work.

*Fusterlandia proves that art doesn't need museums or galleries to transform lives. Sometimes, all it takes is a stubborn artist and a neighborhood willing to dream in color.*
