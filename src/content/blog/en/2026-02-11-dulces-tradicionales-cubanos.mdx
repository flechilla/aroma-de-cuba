In Cuba, sweets are more than just desserts: they're childhood memories, family traditions, and the island's essence condensed into every bite. From street vendors' carts to grandmothers' kitchens, Creole confectionery is a living heritage that sweetens the Cuban soul.

## Cascos de Guayaba: The King of Cuban Sweets

**Cascos de guayaba** (guava shells) are perhaps Cuba's most emblematic sweet. These guava halves cooked in thick syrup achieve a perfect balance between sweet and tart. They're traditionally served with cream cheese, creating the famous pairing known as **"timba"** or "cascos con queso."

Cuban guava has a unique flavor—more intense and aromatic than other varieties. The best cascos are made with ripe but firm fruit, cooked slowly until it absorbs the syrup without losing its texture.

## Turrón de Maní: Crunchy Tradition

Cuban **turrón de maní** (peanut nougat) differs from the Spanish version: these are crunchy bars of toasted peanuts bound with caramelized sugar or honey. It's the quintessential snack of patron saint festivals, parks, and Havana street corners.

Unlike soft Spanish turrón, the Cuban version has that crunchy texture that melts in your mouth, releasing the toasted flavor of premium peanuts.

### Popular Variants

- **Turrón de ajonjolí**: Made with sesame seeds instead of peanuts
- **Maní garrapiñado**: Individually candied peanuts
- **Coconut and peanut turrón**: An irresistible combination

## Coco Rallado: Tropical Sweetness

**Coco rallado** (shredded coconut candy) is simplicity made sweet. Fresh shredded coconut cooked with sugar until it forms a paste that's shaped into balls, bars, or simply served in paper cones.

On Cuban streets, vendors offer paper cones of shredded coconut for just a few pesos. It's the island's most democratic sweet, accessible to everyone.

### Homemade Preparation

1. Shred fresh coconut
2. Mix with sugar (1:1 ratio)
3. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly
4. Shape before it cools

## Dulce de Leche Cortada

Also known as **"natilla de leche cortada,"** this dessert is made with milk that's been intentionally "curdled" with lemon. The result is a creamy dessert with soft curds, perfumed with cinnamon and vanilla.

This sweet was born from necessity—a way to use milk that had curdled in the tropical heat, transforming a "mistake" into a delicacy.

## Other Treasures of Cuban Confectionery

### Boniatillo
Sweet potato purée with sugar, cinnamon, and lemon zest. One of Cuba's oldest sweets.

### Mango Jam
Made with ripe seasonal mangoes, perfect on bread or crackers.

### Pumpkin Flan
A Creole twist on traditional flan, with pumpkin that gives it a golden color and unique flavor.

### Cusubé
Fried sweet potato covered in syrup, typical of Santiago de Cuba.

## The Sweet Business in Cuba Today

Despite economic difficulties, **dulceros** (sweet makers) remain part of the Cuban landscape. In cities, small entrepreneurs sell homemade sweets to supplement their income. The tradition survives because these flavors are irreplaceable.

For the Cuban diaspora, finding authentic sweets is a way to maintain connection with the island. Stores in Miami like [Sedano's](https://www.sedanos.com/) and [Presidente Supermarket](https://www.presidentesupermarket.com/) offer imported products and locally made treats using traditional recipes.
