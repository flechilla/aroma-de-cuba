Cuban Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs **Carlos Fernández de Cossío** clarified in an interview with The Associated Press that the Cuban government is not currently maintaining a dialogue with the United States, but is willing to start one under certain conditions.

## "We're Open to Dialogue"

Fernández de Cossío was precise in distinguishing between dialogue and negotiation:

> "We're not talking specifically about negotiation yet. That's another topic. We're open to dialogue. If we can have a dialogue, maybe that can lead to a negotiation."

The diplomat indicated that Cuba is ready for an **"informal dialogue"** with the United States "with the goal of ensuring we can have a respectful and serious coexistence despite the differences between our two countries."

## Topics Off the Table

The vice minister noted that certain topics are off the table for Cuba:
- The Constitution
- The economy
- The socialist government system

"But there are many, many other topics we can discuss," he added.

## "Cuba Is a Peaceful Country"

Fernández de Cossío emphasized Cuba's position:

> "Cuba is a peaceful country. We only wish to relate to the United States the way we relate to the rest of the world. The United States is the exception today."

## "Very Difficult" Situation

When asked how long Cuba can sustain itself under current conditions, without oil supply from Venezuela, Cossío said he couldn't reveal "any path" for supply.

> "Cuba, of course, is preparing with creativity, stoicism, and austerity. What can Cuba do? Just watch us."

The statements come as Cuba faces an acute economic crisis, continuous blackouts, and the interruption of Venezuelan oil shipments following Nicolás Maduro's capture on January 3.
