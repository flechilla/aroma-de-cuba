faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between arroz imperial and arroz con pollo?"
    answer: "Arroz con pollo is cooked together in one pot, while arroz imperial is assembled in separate layers—yellow rice, shredded chicken, mayonnaise, and cheese—then baked like a lasagna until golden and bubbly."
  - question: "Can you make arroz imperial ahead of time?"
    answer: "Yes, it's perfect for make-ahead meals. Assemble the layers, cover with foil, and refrigerate overnight. Bake at 350°F for 35-40 minutes the next day until the cheese is golden."
  - question: "What cheese is used in Cuban arroz imperial?"
    answer: "Traditionally, Gouda or American-style yellow cheese is used. In Miami, many cooks blend Gouda with mozzarella for extra stretch and meltability when baking."
  - question: "Is arroz imperial Cuban or Cuban-American?"
    answer: "Its exact origin is debated. Some trace it to Matanzas, Cuba in the early 1900s. Others believe it was created by the Cuban diaspora in Miami. Either way, it's become essential at Cuban celebrations on both sides of the Florida Straits."

If [arroz con pollo](/en/blog/2026-02-12-arroz-con-pollo-cubano/) is the Sunday staple of Cuban cooking, **arroz imperial** is its dressed-up cousin—the one that shows up when there's something to celebrate. Baptisms, weddings, quinceañeras, Nochebuena—wherever there's a big table and hungry guests, this golden casserole holds court.

## What is arroz imperial?

Picture a lasagna, but instead of pasta, you have generous layers of **yellow rice** tinted with bijol (annatto). Between each layer: **shredded chicken** braised with tomatoes and peppers, a creamy spread of **mayonnaise**, and a shower of **grated cheese** that bakes into an irresistible golden crust.

It's hearty, festive, and deeply comforting. This isn't everyday food—it's celebration food.

## A Mysterious Origin: Matanzas or Miami?

The history of arroz imperial is as hazy as the steam that rises when you pull it from the oven. One popular theory—though without solid documentation—places it in **Matanzas, Cuba**, where a woman named María Arroz supposedly first served it at her restaurant in the early 1900s.

Other culinary researchers argue that arroz imperial is actually a creation of the **Cuban diaspora in Miami**: a casserole version of arroz con pollo, adapted to American ovens and the need to feed crowds at church potlucks and community gatherings.

Whatever its birthplace, arroz imperial today belongs to both Cuba and its diaspora. You'll find it at paladares in Havana and ventanitas on Calle Ocho alike.

## The Key Ingredients

### Yellow rice (arroz amarillo)

The foundation is **long-grain rice** cooked in chicken broth with bijol or Cuban saffron, which gives it that deep golden color. Bijol comes from the [achiote tree (*Bixa orellana*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixa_orellana), native to the Americas and used by Indigenous peoples long before colonization.

### Shredded chicken

The chicken is boiled whole or in pieces, shredded, then simmered in a sofrito of onion, garlic, peppers, tomato, and dry white wine. It's essentially the same technique used in [fricasé de pollo](/en/blog/2026-02-12-fricase-de-pollo-cubano/), minus the potatoes, with the chicken pulled apart.

### Mayonnaise

Yes, mayonnaise. It's the ingredient that sparks the most debate. But trust me: that layer of mayo between the rice and chicken is what makes this dish **imperial**. It adds creaminess and moisture, preventing the rice from drying out in the oven.

### Cheese

Grated Gouda is the classic choice. Some use mozzarella or a blend. The key is that it melts beautifully and forms that golden crust that is the dish's signature.

## Recipe: Cuban Arroz Imperial

**Prep time:** 45 minutes  
**Baking time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Serves:** 8-10

### Ingredients

**For the yellow rice:**
- 3 cups long-grain rice
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon bijol (or ½ teaspoon turmeric)
- Salt to taste

**For the chicken:**
- 2 lbs chicken breast
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 can crushed tomatoes (14 oz)
- ¼ cup dry white wine (vino seco)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt, pepper, and cumin to taste

**For assembly:**
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3 cups grated Gouda cheese
- Stuffed olives (optional, for garnish)

### Instructions

1. **The rice:** Heat oil in a heavy pot. Add rice and bijol, stir for 2 minutes. Pour in hot broth and salt. Cover and cook on low heat for 20-22 minutes until dry and fluffy.

2. **The chicken:** Boil chicken breasts in salted water for 25 minutes. Shred. In a skillet, sauté onion, garlic, and peppers in oil. Add tomatoes, wine, and spices. Stir in shredded chicken and cook 10 minutes.

3. **Assembly:** Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a greased deep baking dish, spread half the rice as the base. Cover with half the mayo, all the chicken, and half the cheese. Add the second layer of rice, remaining mayo, and finish with cheese.

4. **Bake:** Cook 25-30 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbling. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.

> **Abuela's tip:** For the *de luxe* version, add a layer of [fried sweet plantains](/en/blog/2026-02-12-platanos-maduros-fritos-cubanos/) between the chicken and the second rice layer. You'll thank me later.

## Arroz Imperial at the Cuban Table Today

In Cuba, where finding Gouda cheese can be a logistical challenge, families improvise with cream cheese or even artisanal goat cheese. Mayo is sometimes replaced with a mixture of evaporated milk and egg. The essence endures: layers, flavor, and generosity.

In Miami, arroz imperial is mandatory at [Versailles Restaurant](https://www.versaillesrestaurant.com/), in the cafeterias of Hialeah, and at practically every Cuban celebration worth attending. It has become a symbol of **culinary identity** as powerful as the [Cuban sandwich](/en/blog/2026-02-11-sandwich-cubano/) itself.

## Perfect Pairings

Arroz imperial calls for a **fresh avocado salad** with tomato, onion, and lime. To drink, an ice-cold beer or a glass of [guarapo](/en/blog/2026-02-12-guarapo-cubano-jugos-tropicales/). And for dessert, a classic [Cuban flan](/en/blog/2026-02-12-flan-cubano/) to end on the sweetest note.
