faq:
  - question: "How many detention beds does ICE plan to have?"
    answer: "ICE plans to reach a capacity of 92,600 beds, more than double the 40,000 available when Trump took office in January 2025."
  - question: "What happens to ICE during the DHS shutdown?"
    answer: "ICE operations continue uninterrupted because the agency has $75 billion in previously approved funding from Trump's tax package, independent of the regular DHS budget."
  - question: "How does this affect detained Cubans?"
    answer: "With over 75,000 migrants currently in ICE custody, including dozens of Cubans, the massive expansion of detention centers signals a significant increase in immigration arrests."
  - question: "What are ICE regional processing centers?"
    answer: "These are 16 facilities with capacity for 1,000 to 1,500 detainees each, designed for stays of 3 to 7 days, plus 8 large-scale detention centers housing 7,000 to 10,000 people."

As the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) entered a **partial shutdown** on February 14 due to a funding lapse, an official document reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is planning an **unprecedented expansion** of its detention infrastructure: **92,600 beds** with a budget of **$38.3 billion**.

## The Paradox: DHS Shuts Down but ICE Keeps Running

The Senate blocked DHS funding after Democrats demanded restrictions on Trump's immigration agenda, including changes to federal agent conduct and visible identification requirements during enforcement operations.

However, ICE operations **will not stop**. Republicans have emphasized that both ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have substantial funds approved last year as part of Trump's tax package:

- **$75 billion** for ICE
- **$65 billion** for CBP

These resources can continue to be used for deportations and immigration enforcement, regardless of the DHS budget shutdown.

## The Mega-Expansion: Warehouses Turned Into Jails

A [document released](https://www.governor.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt971/files/media/media_document/merrimack-nh-detention-reengineering-initiative-final.pdf) by Republican New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte reveals ICE's detailed plans:

- **16 regional processing centers** with capacity for 1,000-1,500 detainees, averaging 3 to 7 day stays
- **8 large-scale detention centers** capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 people for periods under 60 days
- **10 existing "turnkey" facilities** acquired directly
- **Target date**: all operational by **November 2026**

ICE has already quietly purchased at least **seven warehouses** — some larger than 1 million square feet — in recent weeks across Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

## Alarming Numbers for the Cuban Community

Current figures are already concerning:

- **Over 75,000 migrants** in ICE custody as of mid-January 2026
- **40,000** when Trump took office in January 2025 — nearly doubled in one year
- **54 Cubans** deported to Guantánamo Naval Base in three flights between December 2025 and January 2026
- **45,000 Cubans** with active deportation orders in the U.S.

For the Cuban community, this massive expansion means more compatriots could be detained in these new facilities, far from their families and lawyers, in centers improvised from industrial warehouses.

## Political Tensions Over New Facilities

The document's release generated political friction. Interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified that DHS had "worked with Governor Ayotte" on plans for a 500-bed center in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

Ayotte responded that the assertion was **"simply not true"** and that the economic summary was sent hours after Lyons testified. The document even contained errors, referring to economic impact in Oklahoma and mentioning state sales and income taxes — neither of which exist in New Hampshire.

In at least **six cities**, warehouse purchases were scuttled under pressure from activists, though new deals in places like New York are imminent.

## Impact on Federal Workers

Of the more than 270,000 DHS employees, approximately **258,000 are deemed essential** and must continue working without pay until Congress approves new funding. Only about 22,000 (5%) were furloughed.

At the TSA, 95% of staff continue operating airports without salary. Many employees haven't yet recovered financially from the previous 43-day shutdown last autumn.

## What This Means for Cubans in the U.S.

The combination of a technically shut-down DHS but a massively funded ICE with aggressive expansion plans creates a complex scenario:

1. **Deportations continue** without interruption
2. **More detention capacity** means more potential arrests
3. **Improvised centers** in warehouses raise concerns about detention conditions
4. **Reduced oversight** during the DHS shutdown could decrease accountability

Cubans with deportation orders, pending cases, or irregular immigration status should be especially vigilant and seek immediate legal counsel.
