Cuba's fuel crisis continues to devastate the aviation sector. **Cubana de Aviación**, the country's flag carrier, has announced it will reduce its Madrid-Cuba route to **just one weekly flight** for the summer 2026 season, according to travel agency Cuba Tulike.

## One Flight Per Week: The New Schedule

The stripped-down operation includes:

- **Outbound (Tuesdays):** Flight CU471 — Madrid (1:30 PM) → Santiago de Cuba (5:00 PM) → Havana (8:20 PM)
- **Return (Thursdays):** Flight CU470 — Havana (8:20 AM) → Santiago de Cuba → Madrid (11:35 AM departure from Santiago)

For the thousands of Cubans living in Spain — one of the largest diaspora communities in Europe — this means fewer options and greater uncertainty when trying to visit family on the island.

## No Fuel Until March

Cubana's decision doesn't exist in isolation. On February 11, Cuban aviation authorities issued a **NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions)** confirming that **no Jet A1 fuel will be available at any Cuban airport until at least March 11, 2026**.

This affects Havana, Varadero, Holguín, and Santiago de Cuba — the country's main international entry points.

## European Airlines Improvise to Keep Flying

Spanish and international carriers maintaining Cuba routes have resorted to creative workarounds:

- **[Iberia](https://www.iberia.com)** and **Air Europa** make technical stops in Santo Domingo to refuel on return flights
- **[Air France](https://www.airfrance.com)** stops in Nassau, Bahamas
- **World 2 Fly** also refuels in the Dominican Republic
- **[Copa Airlines](/en/blog/2026-02-13-copa-airlines-vuelos-cuba-crisis/)** carries extra fuel from Panama (tankering)

These diversions add hours of travel time and significant operational costs.

## The Toll on Spanish Businesses

According to a [report by EFE via Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2026/02/13/la-economia-de-subsistencia-de-cuba-asfixia-y-complica-la-operativa-a-empresas-espanolas/), the situation has deteriorated dramatically since Nicolás Maduro's capture on January 3 and the subsequent oil blockade:

- **Hotel occupancy** has fallen to just **20%**, versus the 70-75% considered healthy
- **Meliá** closed 3 of its 35 hotels in Cuba
- **NH** exited its two Havana properties entirely
- Tourism dropped from 4.7 million visitors during the Obama thaw to just **1.8 million in 2025**
- About **150 Spanish business owners** operate on the island under permanent contingency plans

## An Increasingly Isolated Island

With [Canada](/en/blog/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis/), [Russia](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba/), and now Cuba's own national airline drastically cutting operations, the country faces its worst international air connectivity in decades. Only [Copa Airlines](/en/blog/2026-02-13-copa-airlines-vuelos-cuba-crisis/) maintains relatively normal service thanks to its tankering strategy from Panama.

For the Cuban diaspora in Europe, the message is stark: traveling to Cuba in 2026 will be harder, more expensive, and more uncertain than ever before.
