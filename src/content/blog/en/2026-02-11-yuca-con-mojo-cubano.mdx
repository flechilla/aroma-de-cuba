**Yuca con mojo** is far more than a simple side dish—it's the soul of the Cuban table. This humble root vegetable, bathed in aromatic mojo sauce made with garlic, olive oil, and citrus, has nourished generations of Cubans and remains the star of family celebrations.

## The History of Yuca in Cuba

Yuca arrived in Cuba long before the Spanish conquistadors. The Taíno people, the island's original inhabitants, cultivated it as their staple food and called it *casabe*. They made bread, fermented drinks, and various dishes from yuca that sustained their communities.

When Spanish colonizers arrived, they brought garlic, olive oil, and citrus fruits. From this fusion, **mojo criollo** was born—that magical sauce that transforms simple boiled yuca into an irresistible delicacy.

## Ingredients for Yuca con Mojo

### For the Yuca
- 2 lbs fresh yuca (cassava)
- Water to cover
- 1 tablespoon salt
- Juice of 1 lime (optional, prevents browning)

### For the Mojo Criollo
- 10-12 large garlic cloves
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Juice of 2 limes (or 3 sour oranges if available)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Step-by-Step Preparation

### Step 1: Prepare the Yuca

Peel the yuca, removing both the brown outer bark and the pinkish inner layer. Cut into 3-inch pieces and remove the fibrous center core (the "string" running through the middle).

### Step 2: Boil the Yuca

Place the pieces in a large pot with cold water to cover completely. Add salt and lime juice. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for **25-35 minutes**.

The yuca is ready when you can easily pierce it with a fork but it still holds its shape. Don't overcook or it will fall apart!

### Step 3: Make the Mojo

While the yuca cooks, prepare the mojo. This is the secret to the entire dish:

1. **Crush the garlic** with coarse salt in a mortar until it forms a paste. If you don't have a mortar, mince it very finely.
2. **Heat the olive oil** in a small pan over medium-low heat. It should not smoke.
3. **Add the garlic** and cook for only 30-45 seconds, stirring constantly. The garlic should turn lightly golden but never burn.
4. **Remove from heat** immediately and add the lime juice (careful, it will splatter!), cumin, salt, and pepper.

### Step 4: Serve

Drain the yuca and arrange on a serving platter. Pour the hot mojo over the top, making sure all pieces are well coated.

For an extra touch, reserve some crispy fried garlic to sprinkle on top as garnish.

## Secrets to Perfect Mojo

Mojo is simple but demands precision. Here are the secrets that make all the difference:

- **Always fresh garlic**: Garlic powder won't work. You need fresh, firm garlic without green sprouts.
- **Quality olive oil**: It's the flavor vehicle. A good extra virgin olive oil makes all the difference.
- **Correct temperature**: The oil should be hot but not smoking. If the garlic burns, the mojo will taste bitter.
- **Sour orange**: If you can find [sour orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange) (Citrus × aurantium), use it instead of lime. It's the authentic flavor of Cuban mojo.

## Variations on the Dish

### Yuca con Mojo and Chicharrones
In many Cuban homes, yuca con mojo is crowned with crispy pork cracklings. The combination of soft yuca, aromatic mojo, and rich pork fat is heavenly.

### Fried Yuca with Mojo
Another popular option is frying the yuca after boiling. Cut into sticks, fry until golden, then drench with mojo. Similar to [tostones](/en/blog/tostones-cubanos-receta-tradicion/) but made with yuca.

## Nutritional Value

Yuca is an excellent source of:
- **Complex carbohydrates** for sustained energy
- **Dietary fiber** for digestion
- **Vitamin C** (especially if not overcooked)
- **Potassium** for muscle function

It's naturally gluten-free, making it ideal for people with [celiac disease](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/).

## Perfect Pairings

Yuca con mojo perfectly accompanies:
- **Lechón asado**: The classic Cuban Christmas roast pork
- **Masas de puerco**: Marinated and fried pork chunks
- **Cuban-style roast chicken**: With traditional Cuban spices
- **Ropa vieja**: Cuba's most famous shredded beef stew

To drink, a **mojito** or cold beer perfectly complements the garlic and citrus flavors of the mojo. And for something non-alcoholic, [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/cafe-cubano-historia-receta-espuma/) after the meal is an obligatory tradition.

## Conclusion

Yuca con mojo is the essence of Cuban cooking: humble ingredients transformed into something extraordinary through technique and tradition. Making it at home connects you with generations of Cuban cooks who have passed this recipe from hand to hand.

The key? Respect the timing, use fresh ingredients, and don't fear the garlic. As they say in Cuba: *"He who has no garlic has no flavor."*
