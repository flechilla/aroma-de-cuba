In a statement that has shaken the international political landscape, U.S. President **Donald Trump** raised the possibility of a **"friendly takeover"** of Cuba this Friday. According to the president, the Cuban government is in "high-level" talks with his administration, specifically under the direction of Secretary of State **Marco Rubio**.

## What Does a "Friendly Takeover" Mean?

During a brief encounter with reporters before leaving the White House, Trump described the island's economic situation as desperate. "The Cuban government is talking with us. They have no money. They have no anything right now," he stated. The president suggested that this "takeover" would not be military in nature, but rather a controlled and strategic transition.

Additional reports suggest that Washington's strategy could focus on controlling energy infrastructure and a gradual economic opening. This move occurs in a context of high regional tension, following the recent capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, which has left Havana without one of its most important economic allies.

## The Role of Marco Rubio

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been identified as the main architect of these negotiations. Trump assured that Rubio is handling the matter at a "very high level." The involvement of Rubio, known for his firm stance against the Cuban regime, suggests that any agreement would seek deep structural changes in the island's governance in exchange for economic relief or U.S. investment.

## Reactions and Uncertainty

While some sectors of the diaspora see this as a historic opportunity for a democratic transition, others are skeptical given the lack of details on what a "friendly takeover" would actually entail in terms of sovereignty. So far, the government in Havana has not issued a detailed official confirmation regarding the content of these alleged high-level talks.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Is the "friendly takeover" a military invasion?
No, President Trump has suggested a non-military approach, focusing on diplomacy and economic/strategic control.

### 2. Why is Cuba negotiating now?
The island is facing its most severe energy crisis in decades, combined with skyrocketing inflation and the loss of support from key allies like Venezuela.

### 3. What does the Cuban government say?
While Trump claims they are in talks, the Havana regime is typically secretive about negotiations with the U.S., although the current economic pressure is unprecedented.

### 4. What role does Marco Rubio play in this?
As Secretary of State, Rubio leads policy toward Latin America and is the primary interlocutor in efforts to force or negotiate a system change in Cuba.
