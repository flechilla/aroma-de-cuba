Spanish hotel chain **Meliá** has reduced its hotel availability in Cuba, temporarily closing three of its properties on the island in response to dramatically declining occupancy levels.

## "Strictly Operational" Decision

Company sources confirmed to EFE news agency that this decision was made to:
- **Optimize resources**
- **Ensure the best service and experience** for guests who do stay

The company did not specify which hotels were affected or their specific locations on the island.

## Operational Guarantees

Despite the cutbacks, Meliá assured that:

> "We currently have supplies on hand to support the operational continuity of our facilities on the island."

Cuban tourism authorities, according to the hotel chain, have confirmed that fuel is available to guarantee normal operations at hotels that remain open.

## Unprecedented Tourism Crisis

Meliá's adjustment comes at the worst moment for Cuban tourism in decades:

| Year | Visitors | Change |
|------|----------|--------|
| **2019** | 4+ million | (pre-pandemic) |
| **2023** | 2.4 million | - |
| **2024** | 2.2 million | -8% |
| **2025** | 1.8 million | -18% |
| **2026 (target)** | 2.6 million | (not achieved) |

The sector never recovered from the pandemic's impact and, far from bouncing back, has suffered continuous decline since 2023.

## Oil Blockade Impact

Adding to the structural decline is the energy crisis deepened by the Trump administration's oil blockade:

- **Air Canada**: Suspended all flights until May
- **Iberia and Air Europa**: Making technical stops in Dominican Republic
- **State hotels**: Some closed with tourists relocated
- **Power outages**: Up to 20 hours daily in some provinces

## Tour Operator Coordination

Meliá reported maintaining "close communication and collaboration" with tour operators to offer alternatives to guests affected by these adjustments.

Cuba's tourism crisis threatens to deepen as long as fuel shortages persist and international airlines continue adjusting or canceling operations.
