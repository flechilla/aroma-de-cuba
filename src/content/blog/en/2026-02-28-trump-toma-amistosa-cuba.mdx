President Donald Trump has shaken the international political landscape by announcing his intention to initiate what he describes as a "friendly and controlled takeover" of Cuba. In an announcement that has sent shockwaves from Washington to Havana, Trump outlined a strategic approach to influence the future of the island.

## A New Approach for Cuba

Unlike traditional policies of isolation or direct confrontation, Trump's plan suggests a deeper intervention in the island's economic and diplomatic management. According to close sources, the goal would be to assume economic management authority over Cuba within 30 days, seeking a transition toward more democratic and open structures.

### Key Points of the Announcement:
*   **Economic Management:** The United States would seek to oversee key sectors of the Cuban economy to stabilize the energy and food crises.
*   **Controlled Transition:** It is emphasized that the process would not be military but a "friendly takeover" based on diplomatic pressure and control of resources.
*   **Havana's Reaction:** Miguel Díaz-Canel has reiterated his stance against the embargo, avoiding direct mention of Trump's terms, while the country faces an unprecedented internal crisis.

## What Does a "Friendly Takeover" Mean?

The term has sparked debate among experts. Some suggest it is a temporary "economic protectorate" model to prevent a total collapse of the island that could trigger a massive migration crisis toward Florida. Others see it as an aggressive negotiating tactic to force changes in the Cuban regime.

The news comes at a time of extreme tension, with constant blackouts in Cuba and record inflation that has left the Cuban peso at historic lows.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Is this a military invasion?
No, the announcement specifies that it is a "friendly and controlled" takeover, focused on economic and diplomatic management, not the use of armed force.

### 2. When would this plan begin?
Figures close to Trump have mentioned a 30-day period for the United States to assume authority in the island's economic management.

### 3. How has the Cuban government responded?
So far, the Cuban leadership has maintained its usual rhetoric against the U.S. embargo, without formally responding to the "controlled takeover" proposal.

### 4. What impact will it have on Cuban citizens?
The stated intention is to stabilize the economy and basic services, but there is uncertainty about how it would be implemented in practice and its effect on national sovereignty.
