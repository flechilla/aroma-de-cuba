A 28-year-old from Havana has just written a new chapter in the glorious history of [Cuban ballet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ballet_of_Cuba). **Carlos Patricio Revé** has been named Principal dancer at the [Royal Ballet in London](https://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-royal-ballet) for the 2026-2027 season, becoming one of the youngest artists to reach this position at one of the world's most prestigious companies.

## From Havana to the Royal Opera House

Revé's story is a testament to the rigor and excellence of the **Cuban School of Ballet**, founded by [Alicia Alonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Alonso) and renowned worldwide for its distinctive technique. Trained in this tradition from childhood, the Havana-born dancer debuted with the National Ballet of Cuba in leading roles in *Don Quixote*, *Giselle*, *Swan Lake*, and *Carmen*.

At just 19, [Viengsay Valdés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viengsay_Vald%C3%A9s)—current director of the BNC—chose him as her partner, an extraordinary recognition for such a young artist. This would mark only the beginning of a career that would take him to stages across the United States, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, Mexico, and China.

## Seven Years in Australia: The Quiet Preparation

In 2018, Revé joined **Queensland Ballet** in Australia as a principal dancer, where he spent seven years perfecting his art under the mentorship of Mary and Li Cunxin. This period, far from the European spotlight, proved crucial for his artistic development.

> "Ballet is the summary of my life. It has been my salvation in my worst moments, my best moments, my friendships—it has been everything."

## 2025: The Year Everything Changed

The turning point came in May 2025, when Revé debuted at the Royal Ballet as **Romeo** alongside the legendary [Natalia Osipova](https://www.roh.org.uk/people/natalia-osipova). The chemistry between the two artists was immediate, and the company was impressed by his stage presence.

Months later, he starred in *Don Quixote* at Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires alongside [Marianela Núñez](https://www.roh.org.uk/people/marianela-nunez), a Principal of the Royal Ballet. These performances, part of the Argentine theater's centennial celebrations, cemented his international reputation.

Kevin O'Hare, Director of The Royal Ballet, didn't hesitate to praise the Cuban: *"His style and artistry have already made a great impression during his guest appearances. These qualities, combined with a natural stage presence, align so well with The Royal Ballet."*

## The Legacy of the Cuban School

Revé joins a tradition of Cuban dancers who have conquered international stages. [Carlos Acosta](/en/blog/carlos-acosta-legado-ballet-cubano/) was for years the star of the Royal Ballet; José Manuel Carreño shone at the American Ballet Theatre; Lorena Feijóo conquered San Francisco; and Osiel Gouneo is currently a principal at the Munich State Ballet.

What distinguishes these artists is precisely the training they received in Havana: a refined technique that combines the elegance of Russian classical ballet with a unique dramatic expressiveness.

## A Childhood Dream Fulfilled

In his own words, shared on social media after the announcement:

> "I grew up admiring this company, admiring its dancers, its repertoire, and dreaming of one day dancing these roles. Being here feels like the fulfillment of a childhood dream and the beginning of a very special chapter in my career and life."

Patricio Revé has not only achieved a personal goal—he has reaffirmed Cuba's prestige in world classical ballet, proving that a Caribbean island continues to produce some of the finest dancers on the planet.
