The Kremlin escalated its response to the Cuban crisis today, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov declaring that **"the situation in Cuba is really critical"** and accusing the United States of employing "suffocating tactics" against the island.

## Moscow promises "all possible assistance"

In statements to reporters on Monday, Peskov confirmed that Russia is maintaining "intensive contacts" with Cuba through diplomatic and other channels, and is discussing "possible solutions" to help the Havana government.

> "The suffocating measures employed by the United States are causing many difficulties for the country. We are discussing with our Cuban friends possible ways to resolve these problems, or at least to provide all possible assistance."
> 
> — Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also reiterated Moscow's "solidarity" with the peoples of Venezuela and Cuba: "We are convinced that only they can determine their own destiny."

## Cuba denounces "cruel aggression"

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez responded sharply to U.S. policies, denouncing a **"cruel aggression"** designed to "break the political will of the Cuban people."

"The situation is tough and will demand great sacrifice," Rodríguez acknowledged, while reiterating Cuba's willingness to engage in dialogue "on its own terms."

## Mexico: "You cannot strangle a people like this"

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also spoke out on Monday, calling sanctions that harm the Cuban people "not right" and "very unfair."

> "We will continue supporting them and taking all necessary diplomatic actions to restore oil shipments to Cuba. You cannot strangle a people like this. It's very unfair, very unfair."
> 
> — Claudia Sheinbaum, President of Mexico

## The geopolitical chessboard

The Cuban crisis has become a friction point in international relations:

- **U.S.**: Declared Cuba an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to national security
- **Russia**: Criticizes "neo-colonial practices" but seeks to restore ties with Washington over Ukraine
- **Mexico**: Seeks balance between supporting Cuba and avoiding U.S. tariffs
- **UN**: Secretary-General Guterres warned of possible "humanitarian collapse"
