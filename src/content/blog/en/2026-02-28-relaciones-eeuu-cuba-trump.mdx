Diplomatic tensions between Washington and Havana took an unexpected turn this weekend. As U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a "friendly takeover" of Cuba, the Cuban government responded by strongly condemning recent U.S. and Israeli military actions against Iran.

### Trump and the 'Friendly Takeover' of Cuba

In recent remarks from the White House, President Trump suggested that the United States could be preparing for a "friendly and controlled takeover" of the island. According to the president, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is holding talks "at the highest level" with representatives of the Cuban regime.

"They have no money, they have no anything right now," Trump stated, referring to the severe economic and energy crisis the island is currently facing. These words have sparked speculation about the nature of these talks and whether there is a real diplomatic opening or if it's a maximum-pressure strategy.

### Havana Condemns Attacks Against Iran

Almost simultaneously, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla issued a statement condemning the attacks carried out by Israel and the United States against Iranian territory on February 28, 2026. Rodríguez described these actions as violations of Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

This stance reinforces Havana's geopolitical alignment at a time of extreme vulnerability, as shortages of fuel, food, and electricity have pushed the country to a critical point of stability.

### Between Need and Sovereignty

The mention of a "friendly takeover" contrasts sharply with the Cuban government's rhetoric of resistance. Analysts suggest that the talks mentioned by Rubio could be focused on humanitarian aid in exchange for political concessions, although the regime publicly maintains its rejection of any external intervention.
