    answer: "Leaves are gently muddled to release essential oils without completely crushing them, which would make the drink bitter. The correct technique is to press without pulverizing."

The **mojito** is more than a cocktail: it's Cuba's ambassador in every bar around the world. This perfect blend of white rum, fresh mint, lime, sugar, and sparkling water has conquered palates from Havana to Tokyo, becoming a symbol of Cuban tropical joy.

## Origins of the Mojito

### The Pirate Legend

The mojito's origins date back to the 16th century, when corsairs and sailors mixed aguardiente with lime and herbs to combat scurvy and make the rough alcohol of the era more palatable. This primitive drink, called **"El Draque"** in honor of the pirate Francis Drake, laid the foundation for the modern mojito.

### From Aguardiente to Rum

With the evolution of distillation in Cuba during the 19th century, aguardiente gave way to [Cuban rum](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ron-cubano-guia-completa/), smoother and more refined. The drink evolved in Havana's bars, where bartenders perfected the recipe we know today.

## La Bodeguita del Medio

No mojito history is complete without mentioning **[La Bodeguita del Medio](https://www.labodeguitadelmedio.com.cu/)**, the legendary bar in Old Havana that supposedly immortalized Ernest Hemingway with his famous phrase:

> *"My mojito in La Bodeguita, my daiquirí in El Floridita"*

Although historians debate the authenticity of this quote, La Bodeguita remains a temple of the mojito, where hundreds are prepared daily for tourists and Cubans alike.

## Authentic Cuban Mojito Recipe

### Ingredients

- 2 oz (60 ml) Cuban white rum
- 1 oz (30 ml) fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 6-8 fresh mint leaves
- Sparkling water (club soda)
- Ice

### Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Muddling:** Place the mint leaves and sugar at the bottom of the glass. Gently muddle with a muddler to release the essential oils *without* crushing the leaves.

2. **Add the lime:** Squeeze fresh lime juice directly over the muddled mint.

3. **The rum:** Pour in the white rum and stir to integrate the sugar.

4. **Ice:** Fill the glass with ice, preferably large cubes that melt slowly.

5. **Sparkling water:** Top with club soda and stir gently.

6. **Garnish:** Crown with fresh mint sprigs and a lime wheel.

## Secrets to the Perfect Mojito

### The Mint

In Cuba, they use **hierba buena** (*Mentha nemorosa*), different from common mint. Its flavor is milder and less minty. If you can't find it, use spearmint, never peppermint.

### The Sugar

Purists use white granulated sugar, which dissolves gradually. Brown sugar changes the flavor profile. Avoid simple syrups if you're seeking authenticity.

### The Right Rum

[Cuban white rum](https://www.havana-club.com/) is essential. Brands like **Havana Club 3 Years** or **Santiago de Cuba Carta Blanca** are ideal. Never use dark or aged rum, which would overpower the fresh flavors.

## Modern Variations

While the classic mojito is unbeatable, popular variations exist:

- **Strawberry mojito:** With muddled fresh strawberries
- **Mango mojito:** With tropical mango pulp
- **Coconut mojito:** With coconut cream
- **Virgin mojito:** With tonic water and bitters

## Where to Try the Best Mojito

### In Cuba
- **La Bodeguita del Medio** (Old Havana)
- **El Floridita** (to compare with the daiquirí)
- **Hotel Nacional de Cuba** (historic atmosphere)

### In Miami
- **Ball & Chain** (Calle Ocho, Little Havana)
- **Versailles Restaurant** (classic Cuban-American)
- **Café La Trova** (contemporary Cuban cocktails)
