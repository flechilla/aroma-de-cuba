In any Cuban household, from Havana to Miami, **malta** holds a special place in the refrigerator. This dark, sweet, foamy beverage is much more than a soft drink: it's liquid nostalgia, family tradition, and for many, the taste of childhood.

## What is Malta?

Malta is a non-alcoholic beverage made from **malted barley**, water, hops, and corn. Unlike beer, it doesn't go through the fermentation process that produces alcohol. The result is a dark amber drink, slightly bitter but predominantly sweet, with a characteristic creamy foam.

Rich in **B-complex vitamins** (B1, B2, B3, and B6), malta has traditionally been considered a nutritious and energizing drink. In Cuba, mothers gave it to children as a snack, and adults drank it as a restorative tonic.

## Malta Hatuey: The Taste of Cuba

The most iconic brand is [Malta Hatuey](https://www.mibodeguitacubana.com/products/malta-hatuey-6pk-207ml), named after the **Taíno cacique Hatuey**, a hero of indigenous resistance against Spanish conquistadors. Hatuey warned the Taíno people about the arriving Spaniards and led the resistance in eastern Cuba before being captured and executed in Yara in 1512.

The Ron Bacardi S.A. Company began producing beer and malta under the Hatuey brand in **Santiago de Cuba in 1927**. The iconic feathered Indian that adorns the bottles became a recognizable symbol for generations of Cubans.

After nationalization in 1960, production continued under Empresa Cervecería Hatuey Santiago in Cuba. Meanwhile, the Bacardi family, from exile, resumed Malta Hatuey production in the United States starting in 2011, keeping the tradition alive for the diaspora.

## Other Cuban Maltas

Besides Hatuey, there are other popular brands:

- **Malta Bucanero**: Produced in Cuba, available in 350ml bottles
- **Malta Guajira**: Cuban brand sold in MLC stores
- **Malta India**: Although Puerto Rican, very popular among Cubans
- **Materva**: The Cuban yerba mate soda, different but equally beloved

## Malta with Milk: The Cuban Shake

The most beloved way to drink malta is mixed with **condensed milk** or evaporated milk. This combination, known simply as "malta con leche," is:

### Classic Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1 bottle of very cold malta

1. Pour the condensed milk into a tall glass
2. Slowly add the cold malta, stirring
3. Mix well until combined
4. Add ice if desired

The result is a creamy, sweet, and comforting drink that many Cubans remember from their childhood. Some families add a splash of vanilla or a pinch of cinnamon.

Malta offers several benefits:

- **B Vitamins**: Support energy metabolism
- **Iron**: Helps prevent anemia

For Cubans in the diaspora, opening a Malta Hatuey is opening a time capsule. The flavor instantly transports you to afternoons of dominoes on the porch, summers at the beach, the kitchen of your childhood home.

Whether cold straight from the bottle or mixed with condensed milk, Cuban malta continues to win over palates and hearts, generation after generation.
