faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between mojo criollo and garlic mojo?"
    answer: "Traditional Cuban mojo criollo includes sour orange in addition to garlic and lime, while garlic mojo is simpler. Both use cumin and olive oil as a base."
  - question: "How do I know when the yuca is ready to serve?"
    answer: "Yuca is perfect when a fork pierces it easily but it holds its shape. It should be tender but not falling apart, approximately 25-30 minutes of cooking."
  - question: "Can I make yuca con mojo with frozen cassava?"
    answer: "Yes, frozen yuca works very well and is more practical. It comes already peeled and ready to boil. Just adjust cooking time by a few extra minutes."
  - question: "Why doesn't my mojo turn golden like in restaurants?"
    answer: "The secret is browning the garlic without burning it over medium-low heat before adding the liquids. The garlic should be fragrant and lightly golden, never dark brown."

At every Cuban table, from Havana to Miami, there's one dish that never fails to appear when serving [roast pork](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ropa-vieja-cuban-national-dish-recipe-history/) or any family celebration: **yuca con mojo**. This humble root, bathed in a sauce of garlic, citrus, and olive oil, represents the very essence of Cuban cuisine — simple ingredients transformed into something extraordinary.

## Yuca: Ancestral Root of the Caribbean

Yuca (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as cassava or manioc, arrived in Cuba long before the Spanish. The Taíno, the island's indigenous people, cultivated it as a staple food and called it "casabe." From it, they made bread that could be preserved for months — the Caribbean's first "fast food."

Today, [cassava remains fundamental](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL) to tropical agriculture, feeding more than 800 million people worldwide. But nowhere prepares it quite like Cuba.

## Mojo: The Liquid Soul of Cuban Cooking

Mojo criollo is more than a sauce — it's the culinary DNA of Cuba. Its basic ingredients reveal the island's history:

- **Garlic**: Spanish heritage, cultivated in Cuba since the 16th century
- **Sour orange**: A unique Caribbean citrus, the secret ingredient
- **Olive oil**: Mediterranean tradition that took root in the tropics
- **Cumin**: A spice that arrived with Arab traders via Spain

The combination creates something that exists in no other cuisine: a perfect balance of acid, heat, and aroma.

## Traditional Recipe: Yuca con Mojo Criollo

### Ingredients

**For the yuca:**
- 2 lbs fresh yuca (or frozen)
- Water to cover
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 bay leaf

**For the mojo:**
- 10 large garlic cloves, crushed
- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup sour orange juice (or half lime, half orange juice)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt to taste
- Red onion slices (optional, for garnish)

### Preparing the Yuca

1. **Peel the yuca** removing the thick bark and the pinkish layer underneath. If using frozen yuca, this step is already done.

2. **Cut into pieces** about 3 inches long. Remove the woody central fiber from each piece.

3. **Boil in salted water** with bay leaf. The water should completely cover the yuca.

4. **Cook for 25-30 minutes** until tender but not falling apart. A fork should pierce it easily.

5. **Drain well** and place on a serving dish.

### Preparing the Mojo

1. **Heat the oil** over medium-low heat in a small pan. It should not smoke.

2. **Add the crushed garlic** and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. It should turn lightly golden and fragrant — never dark.

3. **Remove from heat** immediately and add the cumin. The residual heat will activate it.

4. **Add the sour orange juice** carefully (it will splatter). The mixture will sizzle.

5. **Season with salt** and pour over the hot yuca.

6. **Garnish with red onion** slices if desired.

## Grandmother's Secrets

### The Garlic Trick
Veteran Cuban cooks crush garlic with coarse salt in a mortar. This creates a paste that distributes flavor evenly and prevents raw or burnt pieces.

### Sour Orange
If you can't find [sour orange](https://www.thespruceeats.com/sour-orange-substitute-4175044) (*Citrus × aurantium*), the classic substitution is mixing sweet orange juice with lime juice in equal parts. Some add a pinch of grapefruit zest.

### The Mojo Moment
The mojo must be poured over the yuca **immediately** after making it, while both are hot. Yuca absorbs flavors like a sponge — waiting means losing the magic.

## Cuban Pairings

Yuca con mojo is the perfect side dish for:

- **[Roast pork](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ropa-vieja-cuban-national-dish-recipe-history/)**: The Christmas Eve classic
- **Ropa vieja**: The shredded beef absorbs the extra mojo
- **Roast chicken**: Simple and perfect
- **[Moros y cristianos](/en/blog/2026-02-11-moros-y-cristianos/)**: The holy trinity of the Cuban table

## Regional Variations

In **Oriente** (Santiago de Cuba), mojo tends to be spicier, with ají cachucha peppers or even a touch of habanero.

In **Havana**, the style is milder, letting garlic be the absolute protagonist.

In **Miami and Tampa**, the Cuban community has maintained the traditional recipe but often uses frozen yuca from brands like [Goya](https://www.goya.com/en/products/frozen-cassava) for convenience.

## More Than Food: Living Tradition

Yuca con mojo appears at every important Cuban celebration. It's the dish grandmothers teach their granddaughters, the one served at weddings and baptisms, the one that makes exiles cry with nostalgia when they smell it in a Calle Ocho restaurant.

It's not just food. It's memory, it's identity, it's Cuba on a plate.
