The Center for Studies of the Cuban Economy (CEEC), an official government institution, has published a devastating report: **Cuba's GDP contracted by approximately 5% in 2025**, accumulating a decline of more than 15% since 2020.

## The numbers the government didn't want to publish

Although President Miguel Díaz-Canel had admitted a 4% reduction in the first three quarters, the CEEC study reveals a harsher reality:

- **Electricity generation**: fell 13.7% year-over-year
- **Emigration**: Cuba has lost **1.5 million people** in five years
- **Infant mortality**: rose to 9.8 per thousand (from approximately 5 per thousand in 2020)
- **Official inflation**: 14.07% annually, but independent estimates place the increase in basic goods at **70%**

## "An exhausted economic model"

The document doesn't mince words. It describes Cuba's economy as trapped in "an exhausted economic model without effective mechanisms," pointing to the "absence of substantial structural and macroeconomic reforms."

> "Cuba is going through what could be described as a 'critical juncture' defined as a situation of intersection and overlap of several crises: social unrest, questioning of established institutions, breakdown of 'normality'..."

## The energy crisis as the axis of collapse

The CEEC describes the state of the National Electric System as "critical," noting the aging of thermoelectric plants, many built in the 1960s and 70s with Soviet technology.

This energy crisis acted as a "drag axis on the rest of the sectors," paralyzing industries, affecting hospitals, and darkening homes with blackouts that have become daily occurrences.

## 2026: A year of total uncertainty

The study, completed before the current [U.S. oil blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights), already described the official growth forecast of 1% for 2026 as "optimistic."

With the [cutoff of supplies from Mexico](/en/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-halts-oil-shipments-cuba-first-time-decade) and Venezuela, and [emergency measures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals) that include closed universities and a four-day work week, the outlook for 2026 is now even grimmer than the CEEC anticipated.
