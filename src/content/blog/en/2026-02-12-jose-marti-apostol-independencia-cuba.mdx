faq:
  - question: "Why is José Martí considered Cuba's national hero?"
    answer: "José Martí is Cuba's national hero because he dedicated his entire life to Cuba's independence from Spanish colonialism. He founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in 1892, unified Cuban exiles, and organized the War of Independence in 1895, where he died fighting at Dos Ríos at just 42 years old."
  - question: "What are José Martí's most important literary works?"
    answer: "His most celebrated works are Versos sencillos (1891), which provided the lyrics for 'Guantanamera'; Ismaelillo (1882), considered a precursor of Modernism; Versos libres (published posthumously in 1913); and his essay Nuestra América (1891), a manifesto of Latin American thought."
  - question: "What is the connection between José Martí and the song 'Guantanamera'?"
    answer: "The famous song 'Guantanamera', popularized worldwide by Joseíto Fernández and Pete Seeger, uses fragments from Martí's Versos sencillos as its lyrics. The verses 'Yo soy un hombre sincero / de donde crece la palma' (I am a sincere man / from where the palm tree grows) are recognized across the globe thanks to this song."
  - question: "Where can you visit José Martí's birthplace in Havana?"
    answer: "José Martí's birthplace is located at 314 Paula Street (now Leonor Pérez Street) in Old Havana. It has served as a museum since 1925 and preserves personal objects, manuscripts, and photographs of the Apostle. It's one of Cuba's most visited historic sites."

## A Boy from Havana Who Changed a Continent

At 314 Paula Street in Old Havana, on January 28, 1853, a child was born who would change Cuba's destiny and reshape Latin American letters. José Julián Martí Pérez came into the world in a humble family of Spanish immigrants — his father Mariano was Valencian, his mother Leonor was Canarian — with no one suspecting that this thin boy would become the soul of a nation.

At twelve, the poet [Rafael María de Mendive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Mendive) discovered young Martí's talent and became his mentor. It was Mendive who ignited in him the flame of literature and, unwittingly, of rebellion. When the [Ten Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years%27_War) erupted in 1868, Martí was barely fifteen — and already writing independence manifestos.

## Prison, Exile, and the Forging of Character

At seventeen, Martí was sentenced to **six years of hard labor** in the San Lázaro quarries. Political imprisonment scarred his body — the chains left wounds he would carry for life — but tempered his spirit. In *El presidio político en Cuba* (Political Prison in Cuba, 1871), his first major text, he denounced the horrors of the Spanish colonial system with astonishing maturity.

Deported to Spain, he studied Law and Philosophy at the [University of Zaragoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zaragoza). Spain gave him education, friendships, and a mastery of Spanish that few could match, but it never made him forget his mission: **a free Cuba**.

> *"I have lived in the monster, and I know its entrails; — and my sling is the sling of David."*
> — José Martí, letter to Manuel Mercado (1895)

## The Pilgrim of the Americas

Between 1875 and 1881, Martí lived a pilgrimage through Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela. In each country he left his mark as a journalist, professor, and orator. In Guatemala he fell in love with María García Granados — the celebrated "Girl from Guatemala" of his [Versos sencillos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versos_sencillos) — whose early death marked him profoundly:

> *"I want, in the shade of a wing, / to tell this story in bloom: / the girl from Guatemala, / the one who died of love."*

In 1881 he settled permanently in **New York City**, where he would live for the next fourteen years. From there he built, word by word, the project of an independent Cuba.

## The Poet Who Invented Modernism

Before [Rubén Darío](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Dar%C3%ADo) published *Azul...* (1888), Martí had already revolutionized poetry in Spanish. With **Ismaelillo** (1882) — a collection dedicated to his son — he broke the molds of late Romanticism with fresh imagery, new rhythms, and a musicality no one had achieved before.

His three great poetic works define a trajectory:

- **Ismaelillo** (1882): Paternal tenderness as a vehicle for aesthetic renewal
- **Versos libres** (1878-1882, published 1913): Raw, existential poetry he called "bristling hendecasyllables"
- **Versos sencillos** (1891): The summit. Poems that sound like [Cuban son](/en/blog/2026-02-10-son-cubano-ritmo-que-conquisto-mundo/), like peasant décimas, like a Caribbean breeze

[Miguel de Unamuno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Unamuno) said Martí wrote in Spanish as no one ever had. Nobel laureate [Juan Ramón Jiménez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ram%C3%B3n_Jim%C3%A9nez) considered him the greatest prose writer of the language.

## "Our America": Living Thought

In January 1891, Martí published his most influential essay in the *Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York*: **[Nuestra América](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestra_Am%C3%A9rica)** (Our America). In just a few pages he traced a vision of the continent that remains relevant 135 years later:

- Rejection of cultural colonialism: "Graft the world onto our republics; but the trunk must be our own"
- Warning about U.S. imperialism, decades before it fully materialized
- Defense of indigenous peoples and mestizo cultures
- Education as a tool of liberation

This text is studied today in universities worldwide as a cornerstone of [Latin Americanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Americanism) and postcolonial thought.

## The Revolutionary Party and the Necessary War

On April 10, 1892, Martí founded the [Cuban Revolutionary Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolutionary_Party) (PRC) in New York. It was no ordinary party: it was a war machine funded by Cuban cigar workers in Tampa and Key West, who donated part of their wages to the cause.

Martí achieved what no one else had: **uniting the veteran generals** of the Ten Years' War — [Máximo Gómez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1ximo_G%C3%B3mez) and [Antonio Maceo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Maceo) — with the new generation of revolutionaries. He founded the newspaper *Patria* as the movement's organ and delivered speeches that electrified crowds.

On March 25, 1895, he signed the **Montecristi Manifesto** alongside Gómez, the formal declaration of war against Spain. A month later he landed in Cuba at Playitas de Cajobabo, Guantánamo.

## Dos Ríos: May 19, 1895

Just thirty-seven days after setting foot on Cuban soil, José Martí fell in combat at **Dos Ríos**, near Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba. He was 42. He rode toward the Spanish lines dressed in black, mounted on a white horse — an image Cuba would never forget.

His death was a strategic tragedy: Cuba lost the only leader capable of building the republic he had dreamed of. But his intellectual legacy survived and became the moral DNA of the nation.

## The Infinite Legacy

José Martí is everywhere in Cuba:

- [José Martí International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD_International_Airport) in Havana
- The monumental **José Martí Memorial** at the Plaza de la Revolución, the tallest tower in Havana
- A bust of Martí in every Cuban school, where children recite his verses each morning
- The [José Martí National Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD_National_Library)
- A statue in [New York's Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue_of_Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD)

But his greatest legacy is not bronze or marble. It's textual. The **28 volumes** of his complete works contain chronicles, essays, poetry, letters, speeches, and translations that continue to astonish with their clarity and beauty.

And of course, there's the song. Every time someone, anywhere in the world, sings *"Yo soy un hombre sincero / de donde crece la palma"*, Martí's [Versos sencillos](/en/blog/2026-02-12-nicolas-guillen-poeta-nacional-cuba/) — transformed into [Guantanamera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamera) — continue fulfilling their mission: carrying Cuba to the heart of the world.

> *"All the glory of the world fits in a kernel of corn."*
> — José Martí
