Cuba is experiencing the most severe demographic collapse in its modern history. What began as a constant migratory flow has transformed into an irreversible vacuum: the most recent data from February 2026 indicates that the resident population on the island has fallen to **8 million inhabitants**, a figure not seen in decades and representing the loss of nearly a quarter of its citizens in just four years.

## The End of the Demographic Film

Of the 11.3 million people registered before the pandemic, today only approximately 8.02 million effectively live within the national territory. This decline is not just a statistic; it is the result of an unprecedented exodus facilitated by programs like **humanitarian parole**, routes through Nicaragua, and land border entries.

The impact is visible in every corner of the island. According to data analyzed by various international sources, more than **12,000 doctors and nurses** and about **40,000 teachers** have abandoned their positions to seek a future abroad. This has left the healthcare and education systems on the brink of total paralysis.

## A Country of Seniors and Empty Houses

The greatest tragedy lies in **who is leaving**. The bulk of migration consists of young people between 20 and 45 years old. Their departure not only reduces the current labor force but also eliminates the possibility of future births, accelerating a population aging process that places Cuba as one of the oldest countries in the hemisphere.

"I feel it's the end of the movie," local residents told media outlets like *El País*. With fuel scarce, electricity intermittent, and garbage piling up in the streets of Havana, emigration has become the only viable economic policy for millions of families.

## Migratory Context and External Pressure

This demographic collapse coincides with a period of maximum tension in United States migratory policies. While it is estimated that **[7% of the Cuban population entered U.S. soil](/en/blog/2026-02-21-dhs-7-porciento-poblacion-cubana-ingreso-eeuu-biden)** under the previous administration, current ICE raids and the hardening of deportations are creating a scene of total uncertainty.

Despite **[mass deportations](/en/blog/2026-02-17-drama-cubanos-deportados-eeuu-testimonios)** and the **[risk of total isolation](/en/blog/2026-02-15-cuba-aislamiento-total-riesgo-exodo)**, internal pressure on the island remains so high that the **[Zero Option](/en/blog/2026-02-16-opcion-cero-cuba-crisis-migracion)**—the Cuban government's maximum crisis plan—only incentivizes new routes, even in the face of the **[current deportation crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-11-cubanos-deportacion-eeuu-crisis)**.

The Cuba of 11 million has ceased to exist. What remains is a nation trying to survive with one-third less of its productive and youthful heart.
