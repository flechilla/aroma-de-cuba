In a world where bee populations are collapsing due to massive pesticide use, there's a Caribbean island that has become an accidental beekeeping sanctuary. **Cuba produces 100% organic honey** — not by ideological choice, but through a historical circumstance that turned scarcity into competitive advantage.

## The Accident That Created a Bee Paradise

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Cuba lost access to **80% of its pesticide and chemical fertilizer imports**. What seemed like an agricultural catastrophe turned out to be a blessing for pollinators. Without synthetic chemicals spraying the fields, the entire island became a toxin-free ecosystem where bees thrive.

While in the United States, Europe, and China, bee colonies suffer from *Colony Collapse Disorder* (CCD), **Cuban bees enjoy enviable health**. The island's tropical flora — with its mangroves, royal palms, marabú shrubs, and wildflowers — offers a natural buffet that produces honeys with unique flavor profiles.

## Sweet Numbers: Cuban Honey by the Stats

Cuba's beekeeping industry has grown steadily:

- **9,200 tonnes** produced in 2022, according to Cuba's National Statistics Office (ONEI)
- **90% of production** is destined for export
- **4,700 tonnes** exported to the European Union in 2023 ([Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240520-1))
- Cuba is the **EU's 7th largest honey supplier**
- Generates over **$22 million annually** in foreign currency
- Honey is Cuba's **4th largest agricultural export**, ahead of sugar and coffee

Cuban honey is worth more per liter than oil, according to the [FAO](https://www.fao.org/cuba/en/). Its natural organic certification commands a premium price in European markets, where Germany, France, and Spain are the main buyers.

## APICUBA: The Backbone of Cuban Beekeeping

The state enterprise **APICUBA** coordinates the entire honey production chain in Cuba. Its functions go beyond processing:

- **Training** beekeepers across all provinces
- **Technical assistance** to maintain organic practices
- **Quality control** before export
- Coordination with **Cubaexport** for international commercialization

Private beekeepers — thousands of them scattered across the island — sell their production to the state at international market prices. It's a unique system: the government pays according to global rates and handles export logistics, channeling [98.5% of external sales](https://havanatimes.org/?p=111060) through Cubaexport.

## Varieties of Cuban Honey

Cuba's botanical diversity produces honeys with distinctive characteristics:

- **Campanilla honey** — Light, mild, the most common. Comes from *Ipomoea*, abundant in Cuban fields
- **Mangrove honey** — Dark and robust, from coastal mangroves. Rich in minerals
- **Marabú honey** — Deep amber, from the invasive shrub *Dichrostachys cinerea*. Complex floral flavor
- **Tropical multifloral honey** — A blend of wild nectars, each harvest unique

European beekeepers who import Cuban honey highlight its **exceptional purity** and total absence of chemical residues — something nearly impossible to find from other origins.

## Matanzas: Cuba's Honey Capital

While honey is produced throughout the island, the province of **Matanzas** has established itself as Cuba's most productive beekeeping region. Its vast plains with wild vegetation and proximity to the [Zapata Swamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapata_Swamp) — the Caribbean's largest wetland — offer ideal conditions for bees.

Other notable provinces include **Sancti Spíritus**, **Camagüey**, and **Santiago de Cuba**, each contributing different flavor profiles based on local flora.

## The Dilemma: Export vs. Domestic Consumption

Here's the bitter paradox of this sweet story. While Cuba generates millions exporting premium organic honey to Europe, Cubans themselves have **very limited access** to this product on the island. With 90% destined for export, honey becomes another example of a world-class Cuban product that Cubans can barely enjoy.

This pattern repeats with other island products, like [Cuban rum](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa-marcas-historia/) or [cigars](/en/blog/2026-02-10-habanos-guia-puros-cubanos-marcas/), where premium production is channeled toward foreign markets.

## Traditional Uses of Honey in Cuba

Beyond sweetening, honey has a long tradition of uses in Cuban culture:

- **Folk medicine**: cold remedy, mixed with lemon and rum
- **Cuban propolis**: internationally recognized for its antimicrobial properties
- **Creole cuisine**: glazes for [roast pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech%C3%B3n), dressings for [tropical fruits](/en/blog/2026-02-12-frutas-tropicales-cubanas/) and traditional desserts
- **Beeswax**: used in crafts, cosmetics, and preservation

## Where to Find Cuban Honey Outside Cuba

If you're in the diaspora or simply want to try this premium honey, here are some options:

- **[Apisun Honey](http://www.apisunhoney.com/)** — Specialized distributor of Cuban honey for international markets
- **European gourmet shops** — Especially in Germany, France, and Spain
- **[Miel Factory](https://www.miel-factory.com/products/miel-cuba)** — French online store with certified Cuban honey
- **Latin markets in the U.S.** — Some specialty stores import it via third countries

## A Golden Future

Cuba has the potential to double its honey production. With over **200,000 active hives** and a pesticide-free ecosystem that other countries envy, Cuban beekeeping is positioned for growth. The challenge lies in modernizing equipment, improving logistics, and — perhaps most importantly — ensuring more honey reaches Cuban tables.

In a world obsessed with organic and natural products, Cuba has been decades ahead without even trying. Cuban honey isn't just a product: it's proof that sometimes, the greatest limitations create the best opportunities.
