faq:
  - question: "Who is Daria Mitina and why does her criticism matter?"
    answer: "Daria Mitina is the secretary of Russia's United Communist Party and hosts a political commentary program on Pravda.ru. Her criticism carries symbolic weight precisely because it comes from Cuba's own ideological camp — the Russian left, which has historically been one of Havana's strongest supporters."
  - question: "What investment figures does Mitina cite about Cuba?"
    answer: "Mitina claims Cuba allocated 32% of its investments to tourist infrastructure compared to only 12% to the energy sector. She calls this imbalance 'probably Cuba's fatal mistake, which it is now paying dearly for.'"
  - question: "What is the 'Cuban Missile Crisis 2.0' that Mitina warns about?"
    answer: "Mitina warns that if the situation escalates — with the US exerting maximum pressure and Russia involved in energy supply — it could generate a new geopolitical crisis similar to 1962, which she calls 'Cuban Missile Crisis 2.0.'"
  - question: "Can China solve Cuba's energy crisis as Mitina suggests?"
    answer: "Mitina suggests Cuba could obtain 2,000 MW from China for around $1 billion per year. However, China has already sent rice but avoided committing to oil, suggesting geopolitical caution is slowing that support."

When a government's own ideological allies criticize it, the situation has reached a breaking point. That is exactly what happened this week: **Daria Mitina**, secretary of **Russia's United Communist Party** and host of the "Personal Opinion" program on **Pravda.ru**, delivered a stinging verdict on Havana's investment decisions.

"Cuba committed probably its **fatal strategic mistake** by prioritizing tourism over energy. It is now paying dearly for that."

## The Numbers That Indict

Mitina's accusation is not vague — it comes with figures. According to her, Cuba channeled **32% of its investments into tourist infrastructure** in recent years while dedicating only **12% to the energy sector**. The visible result: gleaming five-star hotels in Varadero while [64% of the country went without electricity](/blog/en/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) at the peak of the crisis.

The data are difficult to verify from independent sources — the Cuban government does not publish disaggregated investment statistics — but the diagnosis aligns with what external economists observe: Cuba bet on attracting hard currency through tourism without first securing the energy base that underpins the entire economy.

## An Ally That Criticizes: The Wound That Cuts Deepest

Mitina's critique stings more than Washington's precisely because it comes from Cuba's own camp. [Russia declared Cuba's situation "critical"](/blog/en/2026-02-10-rusia-declara-situacion-cuba-critica-acusa-eeuu/) and has tried to send fuel — [the tanker Sea Horse was a demonstration of that support](/blog/en/2026-02-21-petrolero-ruso-sea-horse-desafia-bloqueo-cuba/) — but Mitina goes further: she doesn't just blame the US blockade; she points to Havana's own mistakes.

That is unusual. The standard line in Kremlin-aligned Russian media is to blame the blockade for everything. Mitina does that too, but she adds self-criticism: **Cuba enabled its own vulnerability**.

## The Chinese Solution That Hasn't Come

Mitina proposes a concrete solution: Cuba could obtain **2,000 MW of electricity generation from China for about $1 billion per year**. The idea is not far-fetched — China has surplus installed capacity and economic ties with the island — but it overlooks the geopolitical reality: China sent rice, but has preferred not to commit to oil under US pressure.

[Cuba hit a record 800 MW of solar generation](/blog/en/2026-02-12-record-solar-cuba-800-mw/) in February, showing that the energy transition is advancing. But 800 MW of solar doesn't cover the nightly deficit of 1,700 to 2,000 MW affecting the national grid.

## The Foreign Minister in Moscow and the Silence That Followed

Last week, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla [met with Putin and Lavrov in Moscow](/blog/en/2026-02-18-canciller-cuba-putin-moscu-crisis/) precisely to manage this kind of support. No concrete energy agreements were announced. Mitina's words suggest that within the Russian ecosystem, there are voices demanding more self-awareness from Havana before dispensing further aid.

The underlying message is uncomfortable but real: a country that built luxury resorts while letting its power plants age cannot expect its allies to foot the bill indefinitely.
