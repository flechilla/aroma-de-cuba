  - question: "What is the Cuban Adjustment Act and what protection does it offer in 2026?"
    answer: "The Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA), enacted in 1966, allows Cubans who were formally admitted or paroled into the U.S. and have been physically present for at least one year and one day to apply for permanent residency (a green card). It is a unique privilege that exists for no other nationality. In 2026, however, it faces serious limitations due to Trump's policies and the ongoing legal controversy over the I-220A document."
  - question: "Can a Cuban with an I-220A form use the Cuban Adjustment Act?"
    answer: "Currently, NO. In 2022, DHS argued in court that the I-220A (Order of Release on Recognizance) is not equivalent to the formal parole the CAA requires. In 2023, a federal appeals court ruled in the government's favor, closing that door for approximately 500,000 Cubans. However, multiple lawsuits — including a class action led by Miami attorney Mark Prada — are seeking court recognition of I-220A as equivalent to parole. The situation remains under active litigation."
  - question: "Which Cubans are being deported despite the Cuban Adjustment Act?"
    answer: "Those with serious criminal records (aggravated felonies such as murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, major fraud) lose CAA protection and become deportable. Also vulnerable are people who entered without inspection, those with I-220A who lack formal parole, and those with final deportation orders. The 302 Cubans deported in the first two months of 2026 largely fell into these categories."
  - question: "What options does a Cuban in the U.S. have if they don't qualify for the Cuban Adjustment Act?"
    answer: "It depends on each case. Alternatives include: applying for asylum if there is documented political, religious, or identity-based persecution; requesting an immigration waiver if more than 15 years have passed since a qualifying conviction without reoffending; obtaining humanitarian parole; or being petitioned by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident family member. In all cases, consulting an immigration attorney is essential before taking any action."

With **302 Cubans deported from the United States in the first two months of 2026** and thousands more facing deportation orders, the **Cuban Adjustment Act** — the legal instrument that for decades was the principal protection for Cuban migrants — is at the center of a storm. Many people are uncertain whether they still qualify, whether their documents provide protection, or whether they have already lost it.

This guide explains the real requirements, who still has protection, who no longer does, and what has changed.

## What Is the Cuban Adjustment Act

Enacted on November 2, **1966**, during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson at the height of the Cold War, the Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) was designed to give Cubans fleeing communism an expedited path to permanent residency in the United States.

Unlike nationals of any other country, eligible Cubans **did not need an immigrant visa or a sponsor** to obtain a green card. They only needed:

1. To be a Cuban citizen or national.
2. To have been **formally admitted or paroled** into the U.S.
3. To have been physically present in the country for **at least one year and one day**.
4. To not be inadmissible on certain grounds (certain criminal records, security bars, etc.).
5. To not have been "firmly resettled" in a third country before arriving in the U.S.

This unique privilege — with no equivalent for any other nationality — was for decades the reason Cuban arrivals on U.S. soil knew that, given time and the absence of serious crimes, they could stay permanently.

## The Wet Foot / Dry Foot Era (1995–2017)

From 1995, the policy known as **wet foot / dry foot** added a practical dimension: Cubans intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard were returned to Cuba, while those who managed to touch U.S. soil ("dry feet") could remain and use the CAA.

This policy was **abolished on January 12, 2017**, in the final days of the Obama administration. Since then, Cubans intercepted at sea have been treated like any other migrant nationality — returned to their country or to a third country.

## The CHNV Parole Program and the I-220A Crisis

Between 2022 and 2025, the Biden administration created the **CHNV program** (for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans), allowing Cubans to apply from within Cuba for a **two-year humanitarian parole** to enter legally. More than **500,000 Cubans** used this program.

Here the critical problem emerges: while some entered with **formal parole** (meeting the CAA requirement), others — particularly those who crossed the land border before the CHNV program, between 2019 and 2023 — received the **I-220A form** (Order of Release on Recognizance), an administrative supervision document that is **not legal parole**.

This distinction, which attorneys describe as "arbitrary" and whose logic the government has never clearly explained, left **approximately 500,000 people** outside the reach of the CAA. Some arrived exactly like others who did receive parole and have since become permanent residents.

In 2022, DHS took this to court and prevailed when a federal appeals court ruled in 2023 that the I-220A **is not equivalent to parole**. The issue is now in litigation across multiple circuits, including a class action led by Miami attorney Mark Prada seeking judicial correction of what he calls a legal error. See more: [I-220A: The Lawsuit That Will Decide the Future of 500,000 Cubans](/en/blog/2026-02-17-i220a-demanda-colectiva-500mil-cubanos) and our [I-220 Forms Guide](/en/blog/2026-02-11-formularios-i220-cubanos-guia).

The CHNV program was **terminated by Trump on March 25, 2025**, and the Supreme Court upheld the termination on May 30, 2025.

## Who STILL Qualifies for the CAA in 2026

You still qualify if you meet **all** of these criteria:

✅ You are a Cuban citizen or national.

✅ You entered the U.S. with **formal parole** (your document specifically says "paroled" or your I-94 reflects it, or you were admitted at an official port of entry with valid immigration documentation).

✅ You have been physically present in the U.S. for **1 year and 1 day**, continuously or substantially.

✅ You have no convictions for **aggravated felonies** (murder, kidnapping, rape, major fraud, hard drug trafficking such as cocaine or methamphetamine, etc.).

✅ You were not "firmly resettled" in a third country before arriving in the U.S.

✅ Your case has not been administratively closed under Trump's January 2026 suspension of Cuban immigration processing (this requires specific legal advice).

## Who Does NOT Qualify or Has Lost Protection

❌ **I-220A holders without formal parole**: Under the current government interpretation (and the 2023 ruling), they cannot use the CAA. Their cases depend on the outcome of pending litigation.

❌ **People with serious criminal records**: Anyone convicted of an aggravated felony loses all protection. This includes prior convictions from Cuba or third countries.

❌ **People who entered without inspection** (EWI — crossed without any CBP processing): In most cases they cannot directly use the CAA without first "regularizing" their entry, which typically requires leaving the country and using an immigrant visa.

❌ **People with final deportation orders**: A final order does not automatically bar the CAA, but it makes the process far more complicated and generally requires reopening the case.

❌ **Those convicted of certain drug offenses**: Trafficking in cocaine, methamphetamines, or other hard drugs closes the door to the CAA and nearly all immigration waivers.

## The Impact of Trump's 2026 Policies

The Trump administration has taken several actions directly affecting the CAA:

- **January 2026:** Suspension of all Cuban immigration processes, including naturalizations, residency applications, and asylum cases — freezing even those that would otherwise qualify.
- **March 2025:** Termination of the CHNV program, closing the most recent parole pathway for Cubans.
- **Work permit restrictions:** Asylum seekers must wait 365 days. See: [Trump Restricts Work Permits for Asylum Seekers](/en/blog/2026-02-21-trump-restringe-permisos-trabajo-solicitantes-asilo).
- **Accelerated deportations:** The [2026 deportation flights](/en/blog/2026-02-20-segundo-vuelo-deportacion-cuba-116-migrantes-2026) make clear that the U.S. no longer guarantees impunity for Cubans with criminal records.

## What Options Exist If You Don't Qualify for the CAA?

If you are among those who cannot use the CAA, options are limited but do exist:

1. **Political asylum:** Available to people with documented persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group (including sexual orientation). See the case of [the SUNY Upstate hospital workers](/en/blog/2026-02-22-cubanos-trabajadores-hospital-liberados-ice-nueva-york) for an example of this process.

2. **Time-based immigration waiver:** According to attorney Ismael Labrador, Cubans with deportation orders based on crimes committed more than 15 years ago without reoffending may petition to reopen their cases. It is not guaranteed, but the possibility exists.

3. **Status adjustment for those with active parole:** Those with currently valid parole (some remain valid despite the CHNV termination due to court orders) may still be able to adjust status while it lasts.

4. **Family petition:** A U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse, parent, adult child, or sibling can petition for an immigrant visa through family channels, although wait times are very long.

5. **Urgent consultation with an attorney:** Given the January 2026 freeze, certain deadlines may be at risk. Organizations like CLINIC, RAICES, or the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) can connect you with free or affordable legal representation.
