faq:
  - question: "What makes Cuban flan different from Mexican flan?"
    answer: "Cuban flan uses condensed milk and evaporated milk as its base, giving it a dense and creamy texture. Mexican flan often includes cream cheese, making it even thicker. Both have caramel, but the Cuban version is lighter and silkier."
  - question: "Can you make Cuban flan without an oven?"
    answer: "Yes! You can cook it in a water bath on the stovetop, tightly covered with foil, for about 60 minutes over low heat. It also works great in an Instant Pot — about 25 minutes on high pressure with natural release."
  - question: "Why does my flan have holes or air bubbles?"
    answer: "Holes appear when the mixture has too much air or the oven is too hot. To prevent them, mix gently (don't whip), strain the mixture before pouring, and bake at a moderate temperature (325°F/160°C) always in a water bath."
  - question: "How long does Cuban flan last in the fridge?"
    answer: "Cuban flan keeps perfectly in the fridge for 4-5 days when covered with plastic wrap. In fact, it tastes even better after resting at least 8 hours because the caramel dissolves and creates more sauce."

## The Crown Jewel of Cuban Desserts

In Cuba, no celebration is complete without a flan on the table. From [Nochebuena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nochebuena) dinners to Sunday birthday parties, this caramel custard holds the place of honor at every Cuban gathering. Silky, trembling, bathed in a river of golden caramel — Cuban flan is simplicity elevated to art.

Unlike its French cousin, *crème caramel*, the Cuban version has its own personality: sweeter, denser, with the unmistakable flavor of **condensed milk** that arrived on the island in the 19th century and never left the Cuban kitchen.

## A Sweet History: From Spain to Cuba

Flan traces its roots back to [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flan_(dessert)), where it was made with honey and eggs. The Spanish brought it to the Caribbean during colonization, but it was in Cuba where it found its definitive form.

The key transformation came with the arrival of **condensed milk** and **evaporated milk** — canned products that survived the tropical climate without refrigeration. Cuban cooks discovered that these milks produced a creamier, more consistent flan than fresh milk, and the recipe we know today was born.

By the mid-20th century, Cuban flan was inseparable from the island's culinary identity. Every family guarded their recipe like treasure, with small variations: a touch of lemon zest here, a pinch of cinnamon there, an extra yolk for richness.

## The Traditional Recipe

### Ingredients

**For the caramel:**
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons water

**For the custard:**
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 oz / 397 g)
- 1 can evaporated milk (12 oz / 354 ml)
- 6 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch of salt

### Step by Step

#### 1. The Caramel — The Foundation

The caramel is the soul of the flan and the step that demands the most respect. Place the sugar and water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. **Don't stir** — just tilt the pan gently to distribute the heat. When the sugar melts and turns a deep amber color (about 8-10 minutes), quickly pour it into your mold, swirling to coat the bottom and sides.

*Work fast: caramel hardens in seconds.*

#### 2. The Custard — Perfect Simplicity

In a blender, combine the condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Blend on low for 30 seconds — just enough to combine without creating foam.

**The Cuban secret:** strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve. This removes any lumps and guarantees that silky texture that sets a great flan apart.

#### 3. Water Bath — Patience Rewarded

Pour the strained mixture over the hardened caramel. Place the mold inside a larger baking pan and fill the pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the mold.

Bake at **325°F (160°C)** for **50-60 minutes**. The flan is done when a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. The edges should jiggle slightly — it will finish setting as it cools.

#### 4. The Rest — No Shortcuts

Let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (overnight is ideal). This rest is sacred: it allows the caramel to transform into that liquid golden sauce that makes Cuban flan special.

To unmold, run a thin knife around the edges, place a plate on top, and flip with one firm, decisive motion.

## Cuban Variations

The basic flan welcomes interpretations from classic to adventurous:

- **Cream cheese flan:** Add a block of cream cheese (8 oz) to the mixture for a denser, richer version popular in [Miami](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-11-sandwich-cubano/) and the diaspora.
- **Pumpkin flan:** With Cuban pumpkin purée, warm spices, and a splash of rum — perfect for autumn.
- **Coconut flan:** Replace part of the evaporated milk with coconut milk and top with shredded coconut.
- **Guava flan:** With guava paste melted into the mixture — a purely tropical flavor.

## Secrets from Cuban Grandmothers

After decades of making flan, Cuban home cooks have distilled wisdom that no cookbook captures:

1. **Room-temperature eggs** blend better and produce a more uniform texture.
2. **The ideal mold** is aluminum with a lid (the classic Cuban flan mold). Aluminum conducts heat evenly.
3. **Never open the oven** during the first 40 minutes — the temperature change can crack the surface.
4. **Darker caramel tastes better.** Don't be afraid to take it to a deep amber; the subtle bitterness balances the sweetness of the milks.
5. **One day in the fridge** transforms a good flan into an extraordinary one.

## Flan in Cuban Culture

More than a dessert, flan is a family ritual. In many Cuban households, the flan recipe passes from mother to daughter as culinary heritage. There are families where grandma's flan is legendary — and where every attempt to replicate it sparks passionate debate.

In contemporary Cuba, despite the difficulty of finding ingredients, flan remains the go-to dessert for special occasions. Paladares (private restaurants) serve it as the obligatory finale, and abroad, Cuban cafeterias on [Calle Ocho in Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calle_Ocho) or [Tampa](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-11-sandwich-cubano/) serve it with the same pride as [Cuban coffee](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-10-cafe-cubano-historia-receta-espuma/).

If you haven't tried making Cuban flan at home yet, this weekend is your moment. With simple ingredients, a little patience, and plenty of love, you'll have the dessert that has sweetened the lives of generations of Cubans.
