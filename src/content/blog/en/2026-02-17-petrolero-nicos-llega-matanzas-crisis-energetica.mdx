An oil tanker carrying cargo entered **Matanzas Bay** in western Cuba on Monday, docking near the city's energy logistics port amid the ongoing U.S. petroleum blockade. The **Nicos I.V.** is the first tanker to arrive at Cuban ports in over five weeks.

## Breaking the Silence

The Nicos I.V. (IMO 9103843) is a **183-meter chemical tanker** flying the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. According to [EFE](https://efe.com/mundo/2026-02-17/buque-petrolero-cuba-bloqueo/), the vessel appears partially loaded with a capacity exceeding **300,000 barrels**, though the type and quantity of fuel aboard remain unknown.

If coming from a port outside Cuba, it would be the **first tanker to dock since the Ocean Mariner** arrived from Mexico on January 9 with approximately 85,000 barrels.

## A History Linked to Venezuela

The Nicos I.V. is not sanctioned by the United States but holds **active watch status** due to a prior environmental crime and past links to the so-called energy bridge between Venezuela and Cuba.

According to U.S. legal documents, the tanker belongs to the Greek shipping company **Nicos I.V. Special Maritime Enterprises**, with technical and commercial management handled by **Oceanic Shipmanagement Corp.**, also Greek.

Maritime tracking platforms had not registered the Nicos I.V. at Cuban ports in recent weeks, though the vessel may have been operating in island waters without disclosing its position.

## Matanzas: A Strategic Hub

Matanzas Bay's western shore hosts one of **Cuba's most important energy logistics complexes**, featuring the country's largest supertanker base and the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant — one of the island's main power generation facilities.

That installation suffered a devastating fire in August 2022, considered the **worst industrial disaster in Cuba's recent history**, killing 17 people and damaging four of its eight storage tanks.

## The Crisis in Numbers

Cuba produces only one-third of the roughly **110,000 barrels per day** it requires. The [U.S. petroleum blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz/) has caused:

- A **1,723 MW power deficit** during Monday's peak hours
- Demand of 3,180 MW against generation of just 1,457 MW
- Scheduled disconnections affecting over 55% of the island

The Cuban government has activated an **emergency plan** including minimal health and transportation services, suspended in-person university classes, remote work mandates, reduced state office hours, and severe fuel rationing.

## International Context

The tanker's arrival coincides with significant diplomatic activity. UN Secretary-General [António Guterres expressed concern](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2026/02/16/guterres-alerta-del-agravamiento-de-la-crisis-energetica-en-cuba-y-pide-dialogo/) over the deteriorating situation, while [Spain announced humanitarian aid](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/espana-enviara-alimentos-y-productos-sanitarios-a-cuba-como-ayuda-humanitaria/) including food and medical supplies.

Meanwhile, President Trump [confirmed that Marco Rubio is negotiating with Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo/) on a possible deal, as the island teeters between darkness and the hope that vessels like the Nicos I.V. might bring some relief.
