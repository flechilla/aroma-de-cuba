# Cuban Preserves: Jams, Jellies, and Tropical Fruits in Syrup

In Cuba, preserving fruit isn't just a cooking technique — it's an art passed down through generations, born from tropical abundance and the need to save the harvest. From the **cascos de guayaba en almíbar** (guava shells in syrup) that accompany cream cheese on every Cuban table, to the **artisanal jams** of mango and orange, Cuban preserves are a gastronomic treasure that transcends borders.

## The Tradition of Preserving in Cuba

The island's tropical climate produces fruit year-round. Before modern refrigeration, Cuban families developed preservation techniques that are now culinary heritage. The most common method: cooking fruit in **almíbar** (sugar syrup), taking advantage of Cuba's abundant [sugar production](/en/blog/2026-02-12-azucar-cubana-historia-industria/).

Home-based dulcerías (sweet shops), especially in provinces like **Camagüey**, **Sancti Spíritus**, and **Holguín**, keep this tradition alive. Each family guards their recipes closely, passing them from mothers to daughters.

## The Essential Cuban Preserves

### Cascos de Guayaba en Almíbar (Guava Shells in Syrup)

The undisputed king of Cuban preserves. Guavas are carefully peeled, seeded, and cooked in syrup with cinnamon and a touch of lemon. The result: **translucent pink shells** served with cream cheese — the most iconic combination in [Cuban dessert culture](/en/blog/2026-02-11-dulce-guayaba-cubano/).

The guava (*Psidium guajava*) grows wild throughout Cuba and is considered the quintessential national fruit. According to [CiberCuba](https://en.cibercuba.com/), guava shell recipes vary by region, from sweeter versions in the west to spicier ones in the east.

### Guava Marmalade and Paste

The leftover pulp from making shells becomes **marmalade**, and cooking it longer produces the famous **guava paste** — a dense, dark, intensely sweet block cut into slices. In Miami and throughout the diaspora, guava paste is the star ingredient of [Cuban pastelitos](https://abuelascounter.com/guava-marmalade-recipe-mermelade-de-guayaba/).

### Dulce de Fruta Bomba (Green Papaya Preserve)

Green **fruta bomba** (as papaya is called in Cuba) is cut into strips or chunks and slowly cooked in syrup. The result is an amber, fibrous, fragrant sweet. In eastern provinces, it's flavored with **star anise** and orange peel.

> **Fun fact:** In Cuba, the word "papaya" has a different colloquial meaning, so the fruit is called "fruta bomba" (bomb fruit) instead.

### Sweetened Shredded Coconut

Shredded coconut cooked with brown sugar produces a dense, caramelized sweet sold on the streets wrapped in banana leaves. In Baracoa, Cuba's coconut capital, this preserve reaches its highest expression. Learn more about [Cuban caramelized coconut treats](/en/blog/2026-02-12-coquitos-acaramelados-cubanos/).

### Mango Jam

Ripe mangoes (*Mangifera indica*), abundant from May through August, transform into thick, aromatic jams. The **biscochuelo** and **manga** varieties are preferred for their natural sweetness. Cuba has over 40 mango varieties, as detailed in our [guide to Cuban tropical fruits](/en/blog/2026-02-12-frutas-tropicales-cubanas/).

### Sour Orange Jelly

**Naranja agria** (*Citrus aurantium*), essential in Cuban cooking as the base for [mojo criollo](/en/blog/2026-02-11-mojo-criollo-salsa-cubana/), also transforms into a transparent, aromatic jelly with a perfect sweet-tart balance.

## Lesser-Known Cuban Preserves

- **Dulce de toronja**: Candied grapefruit peel, typical of Trinidad
- **Boniatillo**: Sweet [sweet potato](/en/blog/2026-02-12-viandas-cubanas-guia-completa/) purée with cinnamon
- **Dulce de tamarindo**: Sweet-tart tamarind paste
- **Pineapple jam**: With Cuban pineapple and spices
- **Dulce de grosellas**: Small tart berries in concentrated syrup

## The Traditional Process

The Cuban preservation method follows steps that have changed little over centuries:

1. **Selection**: Ripe but firm fruits (for syrup) or very ripe (for jams)
2. **Preparation**: Peeling, seeding, and cutting according to the fruit
3. **Syrup**: Classic 2:1 ratio (sugar:water), cooked to thread stage
4. **Cooking**: Fruit is submerged in hot syrup and simmered slowly
5. **Aromatics**: Cinnamon sticks, cloves, vanilla, or citrus peel
6. **Canning**: In sterilized glass jars, vacuum-sealed
