If there's one dish that defines Cuba's culinary identity, it's **ropa vieja**. These strands of shredded beef, bathed in a tomato sauce with peppers and onions, are much more than food — they're memory, tradition, and the taste of home for millions of Cubans on the island and in the diaspora.

## The Origin of the Name

Legend has it that a poor man, with nothing to offer his family, cooked his own old clothes with so much love that they transformed into meat. Beyond the myth, the name perfectly describes the dish's appearance: the shredded meat resembles strips of old, tattered fabric. "Ropa vieja" literally translates to "old clothes."

The dish has roots in the **Canary Islands** and arrived in Cuba during the colonial era. On the island, it adapted to local ingredients and the Creole palate, becoming something completely new.

## Secrets to Great Ropa Vieja

### The Meat
Traditionally **flank steak** is used, though brisket also works well. The key is cooking it slowly and patiently until it shreds easily.

### The Sofrito
The heart of Cuban flavor: garlic, onion, peppers (red, green, and yellow if available), and tomato. Some add a splash of dry wine, cumin, and bay leaves.

### The Time
There are no shortcuts. The meat needs **2-3 hours** of slow cooking to achieve that perfect texture that melts in your mouth.

## Traditional Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 lbs flank steak
- 1 large onion, julienned
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 can crushed tomatoes (14 oz)
- ½ cup dry white wine (optional)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation:**

1. **Cook the meat:** In a large pot, cover the meat with water. Add salt, half an onion, and bay leaves. Cook over medium-low heat for 2-3 hours until very tender.

2. **Shred:** Remove the meat and let it cool. Save the broth. Using two forks, shred the meat into fine strips.

3. **The sofrito:** In a large skillet, heat oil and sauté garlic until golden. Add onion and peppers. Cook 10 minutes until soft.

4. **Bring it together:** Add tomatoes, cumin, and wine. Cook 5 minutes. Add the shredded meat and some reserved broth. Cook 15-20 more minutes, adjusting salt and pepper.

## How to Serve It

Ropa vieja is **always** accompanied by:
- **White rice** — essential
- **Black beans** — the perfect marriage (together they form "moros y cristianos")
- **Fried sweet plantains** — the sweet touch that contrasts
- **Yuca with mojo** — optional but delicious

## A Dish of the Diaspora

For Cubans outside the island, making ropa vieja is an act of nostalgia. The aroma filling the kitchen instantly transports you to Havana, to Camagüey, to grandmother's house.

It's the dish prepared to celebrate, to comfort, to remember. In Miami, Madrid, or any corner of the world where there are Cubans, ropa vieja remains the taste of Cuba.
