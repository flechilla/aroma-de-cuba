faq:
  - question: "What is the Sea Horse tanker carrying to Cuba?"
    answer: "The Sea Horse is carrying approximately 200,000 barrels of Russian gas oil (diesel-type fuel) to Cuba. It received its cargo via ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Cyprus."
  - question: "When will the Sea Horse arrive in Cuba?"
    answer: "According to maritime intelligence firm Kpler Ltd., the vessel is expected to arrive in early March 2026."
  - question: "Why is this shipment so critical for Cuba?"
    answer: "Cuba received no oil imports during January 2026 for the first time in a decade. Analysts at Vortexa Ltd. estimate the island's fuel reserves could run out by late March without new supplies."
  - question: "Can the US intercept the tanker?"
    answer: "It's possible. The US military presence in the Caribbean has already seized at least nine vessels involved in transporting sanctioned oil. However, intercepting a Russian shipment would significantly escalate geopolitical tensions."

A tanker loaded with Russian fuel is currently sailing toward Havana in what could become **the biggest test yet of the Trump administration's oil blockade** against Cuba.

## The Sea Horse: 200,000 Barrels of Russian Diesel

As reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-20/cuba-bound-tanker-carrying-russian-fuels-to-test-trump-blockade) on February 20, the vessel **Sea Horse** received its cargo through a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Cyprus. According to data from maritime intelligence firm [Kpler Ltd.](https://www.kpler.com/), the ship is carrying approximately **200,000 barrels of Russian gas oil** — a diesel-type fuel used in both transportation and power generation.

The Sea Horse is expected to arrive in **early March**, just as analysts warn Cuba's reserves could be running dry.

> "I would give it until late March before they run out of fuels," Rohit Rathod, senior oil analyst at Vortexa Ltd., told Bloomberg.

## An Unprecedented Blockade Since the Missile Crisis

Pressure on Cuba escalated in late 2025 when US forces [seized a vessel carrying Venezuelan crude](/blog/2026-02-20-cuba-preparada-bloqueo-total-onu) destined for the island. Following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration ordered the interim government to halt oil shipments to Cuba.

Washington also threatened tariffs on any nation supplying fuel to the island, leading [Mexico to cut off shipments](/blog/2026-02-10-mexico-corta-envios-petroleo-cuba-primera-vez-decada) for the first time in a decade.

The consequences have been devastating:

- **In January 2026**, Cuba received no oil for the first time in ten years
- [Satellite imagery shows a 50% drop](/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz) in nighttime light across the island
- [Blackouts have reached 64%](/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba) of national territory

## Russia Defies Sanctions

The Sea Horse shipment comes days after Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez [met with Putin and Lavrov in Moscow](/blog/2026-02-18-canciller-cuba-putin-moscu-crisis). During that visit, Lavrov called any attempt at a naval blockade against Cuba **"unacceptable"** and urged Washington to exercise **"common sense."**

The Russian embassy in Havana previously confirmed that the Kremlin would send crude and refined products as **"humanitarian aid."** This would be the first delivery since February 2025, when Moscow sent 100,000 tons of oil through a $60 million state loan.

However, Russia faces its own international sanctions over the war in Ukraine, and both the US and EU have stepped up seizures of vessels from the so-called **"shadow fleet"** that keeps sanctioned barrels flowing.

## Will the Fuel Reach Cuba?

The big question is whether the Sea Horse can break through the American cordon. The US military presence in the Caribbean has successfully intercepted **at least nine vessels** involved in illicit transport of sanctioned oil.

A recent case involves the **Ocean Mariner**, a tanker frequently used to ship fuels to Cuba, which this month diverted its route and now signals the Bahamas as its final destination. The ship was carrying 30,000 barrels of diesel loaded at the Colombian port of Barranquilla.

Cuba consumes an average of **37,000 barrels per day**, and each day without supply deepens a crisis already affecting hospitals, transportation, and [basic food production](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-20-u1-e199894-s27061-nid321358-cuba-vuelve-al-horno-lena-producir-pan-pleno-2026).

## Between Hope and Uncertainty

Meanwhile, [Cuba's private sector has begun importing fuel independently](/blog/2026-02-20-sector-privado-importa-combustible-cuba), and the government has approved [tax exemptions of up to eight years](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/economia/exentos-de-impuestos-hasta-por-ocho-anos-empresas-y-cuentapropistas-que-inviertan-en-sistemas-de-energia-renovable/) for renewable energy investments.

But these measures are band-aids on a structural crisis. If the Sea Horse reaches port, its 200,000 barrels will offer temporary relief. If intercepted, Cuba will face the most critical scenario in its recent history.

The international community is watching. The question is no longer just whether Cuba will receive fuel, but **what each side is willing to do** to enforce or break the most effective blockade since the 1962 Missile Crisis.
