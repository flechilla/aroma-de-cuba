The beginning of March 2026 marks a new negative milestone for Cuba's domestic economy. The value of the US dollar has reached **510 Cuban pesos (CUP)** in the informal market, according to reference indices consulted this Sunday. This figure represents a continuous depreciation of the peso, which finds no stable ceiling against foreign currencies.

### The Peso's Downfall Continues

The 500 CUP barrier, surpassed just a week ago, seems to have been quickly left behind. The informal market, which governs most transactions for basic goods and remittances on the island, continues to react to the shortage of foreign currency in the state banking system and runaway inflation.

For the average Cuban, this increase translates directly into a higher cost of living. With state salaries remaining stagnant, purchasing power is drastically reduced every time the dollar or the euro increases in price.

### Factors Behind the 2026 Crisis

Several elements have contributed to this critical scenario:
1. **State Supply Deficit:** The inability of official banks to sell foreign currency to the population pushes all sectors toward the black market.
2. **Energy Crisis:** Prolonged blackouts have affected local production, increasing dependence on imported products that must be paid for in foreign currency.
3. **Political Uncertainty:** Recent international statements regarding the situation on the island have generated a climate of speculation in the exchange market.

### Impact on Remittances and Consumption

Families relying on remittances see the amount received in foreign currency go further in terms of pesos, but this is quickly neutralized by rising prices in private businesses (MSMEs) and other shops, which adjust their rates almost daily following the informal rate.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is the current price of the US Dollar in the informal market today?**
As of March 1, 2026, the dollar is trading at an average of 510 CUP in the informal market.

**2. Why does the dollar keep rising in Cuba?**
Mainly due to the lack of foreign currency in the official market, accumulated inflation, and high demand for dollars by those seeking to emigrate or import products for private businesses.

**3. How does this price affect the minimum wage?**
The minimum wage in Cuba becomes insufficient to cover basic needs, as most essential products are sold based on the informal market rate.

**4. Are there signs that the Cuban peso will stabilize soon?**
Economic experts do not foresee short-term stabilization without deep structural reforms in the island's monetary and productive system.
