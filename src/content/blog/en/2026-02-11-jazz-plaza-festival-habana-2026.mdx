In a Cuba battered by constant blackouts, economic crisis, and renewed threats from the Trump administration, a jazz festival managed to light up Havana for a week. The **Jazz Plaza Festival**, in its fortieth edition, demonstrated once again that Cuban music is as resilient as the people who create it.

## Four Decades of Caribbean Jazz

Since its founding, Jazz Plaza has been the showcase where the best expressions of world jazz converge with Cuba's rich musical tradition. Legends like **Dizzy Gillespie**, Max Roach, Roy Hargrove, and the incomparable **Chucho Valdés** — the master of Latin jazz who has defined the festival's sound for generations — have graced its stages.

This year, from January 25 to February 1, the 2026 edition brought together approximately **286 international artists** alongside hundreds of Cuban musicians in over 100 performances across 16 venues throughout the city: theaters, cultural centers like the [Fábrica de Arte Cubano](https://www.ffrancescoleoni.com/fabrica-de-arte-cubano), basilicas, and private venues.

## A Historic Edition Across Three Provinces

For the first time in its history, Jazz Plaza was held simultaneously in four territories: in addition to Havana, stages extended to **Villa Clara**, **Holguín**, and **Santiago de Cuba**. Víctor Rodríguez, president of the organizing committee, acknowledged the complexity of the moment: *"Every year the festival takes place under very complex conditions, but I think they have never been as complex as they are now."*

## Artists Who Defied Circumstances

Despite travel restrictions that have reduced the presence of U.S. artists, the festival featured outstanding figures including pianists **Aaron Goldberg** and **Arturo O'Farrill**, heir to a Cuban musical dynasty. Cuban musicians living abroad also shone, including **Dayramir González** and **Harold López-Nussa**, who maintain their connection to their homeland through music.

**Ernán López-Nussa**, an emblematic figure in Cuban jazz who has been present since the festival's beginnings, recalled times when listening to jazz or rock was considered *"enemy music"* by the authorities. Today, jazz has established itself as a cultural symbol that attracts international interest and represents the best of Cuban artistic fusion.

## Jazz by Generator Light

Cuba's current reality inevitably seeped into the festival. During the week prior, Havana experienced **power cuts of up to 12 hours** in several neighborhoods. Sponsor **Tulip Power** provided generators to keep rehearsals running at Abdala Studios in Miramar, one of the best-equipped on the island.

*"I haven't been able to pump water for five days, and all I eat is spaghetti and pizza. I can't take it anymore,"* confessed a musician during rehearsal, reflecting the daily precariousness Cuban artists face. Yet when they play, all of that fades away.

## Economic and Tourism Impact

For workers and entrepreneurs in the tourism sector, Jazz Plaza represents a vital economic opportunity in times of [tourism decline](/en/blog/melia-reduces-hotels-cuba-tourism-crisis/). A tour guide who preferred anonymity commented that her agency expected to serve 80 clients but ended up with between 60 and 70 due to cancellations over the geopolitical situation.

*"There's a certain amount of paranoia among visitors. We feel compelled to provide them with daily support, sending them photos and videos so they can see that the sky in Havana isn't falling,"* she explained.

## Cuba Is a Country of Music

This phrase from Ernán López-Nussa captures the essence of what Jazz Plaza means to Cuba. In the midst of the worst crisis in decades, music remains the refuge and resistance of a people who refuse to give up.

The festival proved that neither blackouts, nor political threats, nor scarcity can silence the chords of Cuban jazz. Because in Havana, when the lights go out, the people provide the music.
