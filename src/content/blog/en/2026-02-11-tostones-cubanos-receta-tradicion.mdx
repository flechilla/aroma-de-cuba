faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between tostones and maduros?"
    answer: "Tostones are made from green plantains and fried twice for a crispy texture. Maduros use ripe plantains (yellow with black spots) and are fried once, resulting in a sweet, soft dish."
  - question: "Why are my tostones hard inside?"
    answer: "You probably didn't flatten them enough or the oil was too hot during the first fry. They should be about 1cm thick, and the first fry should be at medium heat to cook the interior."
  - question: "Can you make tostones in the oven?"
    answer: "Yes, though the texture differs. Brush plantains with oil, bake at 400°F for 15 minutes, flatten, then bake 10 more minutes. Healthier but less crispy than traditional fried ones."
  - question: "What sauces go best with tostones?"
    answer: "Mojo criollo (garlic, sour orange, olive oil) is the classic Cuban pairing. They also go well with garlic mayo, avocado sauce, or simply salt and lime."

At any self-respecting Cuban table, **tostones** hold a place of honor. These golden discs of green plantain, crispy on the outside and tender within, are far more than a side dish—they're a symbol of Creole cuisine that has won hearts from Havana to Miami.

## The History Behind the Fried Plantain

Plantains arrived in Cuba from the Canary Islands in the 16th century, and Cubans quickly made them a star of their gastronomy. The twice-frying technique—first to cook, then to crisp—likely has African roots, brought by enslaved people who worked the plantations.

The name "tostón" comes from the Spanish verb "tostar" (to toast), though in other Caribbean countries they're known as *patacones* or *fritos verdes*. In Cuba, they're simply **tostones**, and every family guards their own secret for making them perfect.

## Ingredients

For about 12-16 tostones you'll need:

- 3 large green plantains
- Vegetable oil for frying (enough to cover 1.5 inches)
- Salt to taste
- 1 cup water with 2 tablespoons salt (for soaking)

### For traditional mojo (optional but highly recommended)

- 8 garlic cloves
- ½ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup sour orange juice (or half lime, half orange juice)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## The Recipe Step by Step

### 1. Prepare the Plantains

Cut off both ends of the plantain and make a shallow cut along the length of the peel. Remove the skin (if it's stubborn, soak in warm water for 5 minutes). Cut into **1.5-inch thick** rounds.

### 2. First Fry

Heat oil over **medium** heat (about 340°F). Fry the rounds 4-5 minutes per side until lightly golden but still soft. They shouldn't be crispy yet.

### 3. Flatten

Remove and place on paper towels. While still hot, flatten them with a tostonera, the bottom of a glass, or a cutting board. Ideal thickness is about **½ inch**.

**Cuban trick:** Briefly dip the flattened tostones in salted water. This makes them crispier and seasons them from within.

### 4. Second Fry

Raise heat to **medium-high** (360-375°F). Fry the flattened tostones 2-3 minutes per side until **golden and crispy**. Drain on paper towels and salt immediately.

## The Mojo: The Soul of the Tostón

Crush garlic with salt in a mortar. Heat olive oil until warm but not smoking, pour over the crushed garlic, and add the sour orange juice. The mixture should sizzle. Serve hot over tostones or as a dipping sauce.

## Modern Variations

Cuban restaurants in Miami have innovated with tostones in creative ways:

- **Stuffed tostones**: Made cup-shaped and filled with [ropa vieja](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/32620/ropa-vieja/), picadillo, or seafood
- **Tostones al ajillo**: Bathed in garlic sauce like shrimp scampi style
- **Tostone burger**: Using large tostones as "buns" for burgers

At [La Carreta](https://www.lacarreta.com/) in Miami or the legendary [Versailles](https://www.versaillesrestaurant.com/), tostones remain the same as always: crispy, generously salted, and served with that mojo that's pure bottled nostalgia.

## Tips from a Cuban Kitchen

1. **Choose very green plantains** — If they have yellow spots, they'll be hard to flatten
2. **Don't rush the first fry** — The interior must cook completely
3. **Salt while hot** — Salt adheres better to hot oil
4. **Serve immediately** — They lose their crunch within minutes

## A Classic That Never Goes Out of Style

Whether accompanying [lechón asado](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/cuban-style-roast-pork-lechon-asado/) on Christmas Eve, served alongside black beans on any Sunday, or simply as a snack with an ice-cold [Materva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materva), tostones are Cuba in every bite.

*Do you have your own family tostones recipe? Cuban cooking lives in those small variations that each household treasures.*
