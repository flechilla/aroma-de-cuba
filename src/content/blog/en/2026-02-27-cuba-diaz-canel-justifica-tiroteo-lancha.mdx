The Cuban government has finally addressed the tragic maritime incident that occurred earlier this week, in which coast guard troops shot and killed four people on a speedboat coming from the United States. President Miguel Díaz-Canel stated on Friday that Cuba "is not aggressive and does not threaten," framing the military's actions as a defense of national sovereignty.

### An incident under investigation

The event, which took place off the coast of Villa Clara, has triggered international condemnation and renewed tensions with Washington. According to the official version from Havana, the civilian boat ignored multiple warnings before the shooting began. 

Meanwhile, the U. S. government has denied any official involvement in the boat's journey and stated it is independently investigating the facts. Human rights organizations have raised questions about the use of lethal force against a civilian vessel.

### Tensions in the Florida Straits

This incident comes during a period of extreme fragility for the island, which is facing an unprecedented energy crisis and growing economic pressure under the Donald Trump administration. The rhetoric of sovereignty defense is a constant in the regime's discourse, particularly during maritime friction like this.
