At the bar of [El Floridita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floridita), Havana's most famous watering hole, a bronze statue of Ernest Hemingway eternally gazes at the spot where he drank thousands of Daiquirís. But this Cuban cocktail's story doesn't begin in Havana — it starts in the dusty iron mines of Santiago de Cuba, where an American engineer without gin improvised the drink that would conquer the world.

## The Birth of a Legend (1898)

The Daiquiri's history is wrapped in legend, but the most accepted version involves **Jennings Cox**, an American mining engineer working at the iron mines near Daiquirí beach, on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba.

According to the story, during a gathering with colleagues, Cox ran out of gin — the preferred drink of Anglo-Saxons at the time. With an engineer's creativity, he grabbed what he had on hand: **local rum, fresh limes, and sugar**. He shook it all with ice, and the Daiquiri was born.

> "Cuban rum was of such quality that it didn't need to hide behind other flavors. It just needed good companions: the acidity of lime and the sweetness of sugar."

Daiquirí beach, which gave the cocktail its name, was also the scene of the [Spanish-American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War) — American troops landed there in 1898, the same year the drink was born.

## From the Mines to Havana

The Daiquiri traveled from Santiago to Havana thanks to **Emilio González**, a bartender who perfected the recipe at Havana's Plaza Hotel. But it was at **El Floridita**, on the corner of Obispo and Monserrate streets, where the cocktail achieved immortality.

Bartender **Constantino Ribalaigua Vert**, known as "Constante," transformed the Daiquiri from a simple mix into a work of art. He added frappe ice (finely crushed) and whipped the mixture until achieving a silky texture. His technique was so precise he could prepare up to 50 Daiquirís per hour without losing quality.

### The Floridita Recipe

The classic El Floridita Daiquiri contained:

- **45 ml white Cuban rum** (Havana Club 3 years)
- **25 ml fresh lime juice**
- **15 ml sugar syrup**
- **Frappe ice**

The preparation was ritual: shake vigorously with ice, strain into a chilled cocktail glass, and serve without garnish — the classic Daiquiri has no decoration.

## Hemingway and the Papa Doble

Ernest Hemingway arrived in Cuba in 1932 and quickly adopted El Floridita as his "second home." The writer was diabetic and didn't like sugar, so Constante created a special version for him: the **Hemingway Special** or **Papa Doble**.

This version contained:

- **Double rum** (90 ml)
- **Lime juice**
- **Grapefruit juice**
- **A dash of maraschino**
- **No sugar**

Hemingway could drink up to **12 Papa Dobles in one session**, according to chronicles of the time. In his novel *[Islands in the Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_in_the_Stream_(novel))*, the protagonist says: "The Floridita was the best bar in the world" — a sentiment Hemingway expressed repeatedly.

## The Daiquiri During Prohibition

During [American Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) (1920-1933), Havana became "America's bar." American tourists arrived by ferry from Florida to drink legally, and the Daiquiri was the undisputed star.

Havana's bartenders perfected their techniques to satisfy the demand from these thirsty visitors. El Floridita became known as **"The Cradle of the Daiquiri"**, a title it proudly holds to this day.

## How to Make the Perfect Daiquiri at Home

### Ingredients

- 45 ml white rum (preferably Cuban)
- 25 ml freshly squeezed lime juice
- 15 ml simple sugar syrup
- Plenty of ice

### Preparation

1. **Chill the glass** with ice while you prepare the drink
2. **Combine** rum, lime juice, and syrup in a shaker
3. **Add ice** to fill three-quarters of the shaker
4. **Shake vigorously** for 15-20 seconds
5. **Strain** into the chilled glass (discard the chilling ice)
6. **Serve immediately** — the Daiquiri doesn't wait

### Secrets to the Perfect Daiquiri

- **Lime must be fresh**: Never use bottled juice
- **Balance is key**: Adjust the syrup to your taste
- **Temperature matters**: Everything should be very cold
- **Don't "drown" it**: The Daiquiri is small and concentrated

## Daiquiri Variations

From the classic, numerous variants have emerged:

| Variation | Special Ingredient |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Strawberry Daiquiri | Fresh strawberries or puree |
| Banana Daiquiri | Ripe banana |
| Hemingway Special | Grapefruit + maraschino, no sugar |
| Frozen Daiquiri | Blended with ice (slush-style) |
| Mulata | Dark rum + chocolate liqueur |

## The Daiquiri Today

El Floridita still operates in the same location since 1817 (though under different names before). Hemingway's statue, unveiled in 2003, watches from his favorite corner of the bar while tourists from around the world order Daiquirís.

The cocktail is recognized by the [International Bartenders Association (IBA)](https://iba-world.com/daiquiri/) as one of the official cocktails, with a standardized recipe that respects Cuban tradition.

In Miami and Tampa, where the Cuban community keeps traditions alive, the Daiquiri remains the celebration drink — from Christmas Eve to birthdays, there's always an excuse to toast with this perfect blend of rum, lime, and sugar.
