Cuba's National Seismological Research Center (Cenais) recorded a **5.0 magnitude earthquake** southeast of Santiago de Cuba province on Tuesday, the second significant tremor in just three days in the country's eastern region.

## Earthquake Data

| Characteristic | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Magnitude** | 5.0 |
| **Location** | 208 km southeast of Santiago de Cuba |
| **Depth** | 10 km |
| **Time** | 4:18 AM local time |
| **Date** | February 10, 2026 |

The tremor was felt in several localities in **Guantánamo and Santiago de Cuba** provinces, with no reports of casualties or injuries so far.

## Second Perceptible Quake of the Year

According to Cenais, this is the second perceptible earthquake recorded in 2026. The first occurred just two days earlier:

- **February 8**: **5.6 magnitude** earthquake southeast of Guantánamo
  - Minor damage to about 20 homes
  - Several aftershocks recorded

## Recent Seismic History

Eastern Cuba has experienced intense seismic activity in recent months:

- **December 2025**: 6.1 magnitude earthquake in Guamá municipality, Santiago de Cuba
  - 446 aftershocks
  - Over 90 homes affected and 4 state buildings damaged

- **November 2024**: Two strong earthquakes near Pilón
  - Magnitudes of 6.0 and 6.7
  - Over 800 aftershocks
  - 10 people injured
  - 8,600 homes damaged (156 with total collapse)

## Why So Many Earthquakes in Eastern Cuba?

The area with the highest seismic activity in Cuba is the eastern region, specifically along the **southern coast** of:
- Santiago de Cuba
- Granma
- Guantánamo

This high hazard level is due to proximity to the **Oriente Fault**, which marks the boundary between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

## 2025 Summary

Last year, Cenais recorded **4,535 earthquakes** on the island, of which only **15 were perceptible** to the population.
