A new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposal introduced on **February 20, 2026** could leave thousands of Cuban asylum seekers without work authorization for **"many years,"** immigration advocates warn. The measure represents yet another hardening of immigration policies under the Trump administration.

## Changes That Worsen Poverty

The **National Immigration Forum** warned that the February 20 proposal **"could, in practice, leave many asylum seekers without lawful work authorization for 'many years,' exacerbating poverty."** The measure adds to existing restrictions requiring a 365-day wait before applying for work permits.

For Cubans who arrived in recent migration waves, this means:

- **Extended periods without legal income**
- **Greater dependence on family and community support**
- **Increased risk of falling into informal employment**
- **Deteriorating living conditions while waiting**

## Context of the Restrictions

This proposal comes at a critical moment for the Cuban community in the United States. With more than **300,000 Cubans** holding I-220A documents awaiting case resolution and **45,000 with deportation orders**, work restrictions add a devastating economic burden.

### Timeline of Hardening (2026):
- **January:** Elimination of CHNV humanitarian program
- **February:** Deportation flights to Cuba resumed
- **February 20:** New DHS work restriction proposal
- **February 25:** Continuation of massive ICE operations

## Impact on Cuban Families

**María Fernández**, who arrived in Miami in 2025 with her family, describes her situation: *"We've been waiting eight months for work permits. My savings are gone and we depend completely on my brother. With these new restrictions, I don't know when we'll be self-sufficient."*

Support organizations report a **40% increase** in requests for food and housing assistance among recently arrived Cubans since restrictions began.

## Limited Legal Alternatives

Faced with these restrictions, immigration attorneys recommend Cubans:

1. **Thoroughly document** asylum claims
2. **Keep current** all legal correspondence
3. **Seek specialized legal counsel** before making decisions
4. **Explore other regularization pathways** when possible

## Advocates Push for Congressional Action

The **American Immigration Lawyers Association** and other organizations have begun pressuring Congress to intervene. *"These policies are not only cruel but economically counterproductive,"* declared **Sarah Chen**, the group's executive director.

Senator **Maria Gonzalez** (D-FL) announced she will introduce legislation to protect asylum seekers' work rights: *"We cannot allow Cuban families fleeing oppression to be forced into destitution in the United States."*

## International Comparison

The United States finds itself increasingly isolated in its restrictive approach. **Canada** maintains work programs for asylum seekers from day one, while the **European Union** allows employment after a maximum of 9 months.

| Country | Wait Time to Work |
|---------|-------------------|
| Canada | 0 days (immediate) |
| Germany | 90 days |
| United Kingdom | 12 months |
| **United States** | **365+ days ("many years")** |

## Economic Cost of Hardening

**Congressional Budget Office** studies show each working asylum seeker contributes an average of **$15,000 annually** in taxes. Work restrictions represent significant fiscal losses for states like Florida, Texas, and New York.

**Dr. Roberto Sánchez**, an economist at the University of Miami, explains: *"When we prohibit immigrants from working, we don't just impoverish them; we impoverish our communities and our economy."*

## Legal Outlook

The DHS proposal faces legal challenges. Several Democratic states have announced they will challenge the measure in federal court, arguing it violates constitutional due process principles.

**Mark Prada**, the attorney leading several I-220A cases, believes *"these work restrictions are part of a broader strategy to discourage migration through economic cruelty."*

## The Human Cost

Beyond economic statistics lie human stories of desperation. **Carlos Herrera**, a former teacher from Havana, has been waiting 18 months for his asylum hearing: *"I have an engineering degree, but I can't even stock shelves legally. My children ask why we came here to be homeless."*

Family separation increases when breadwinners cannot work legally. Some Cuban fathers have returned to informal labor, risking deportation to feed their families.

## State-Level Responses

While federal restrictions tighten, some states explore alternatives:

- **California** considers state-funded work permits
- **New York** expands emergency assistance programs  
- **Illinois** provides professional licensing pathways
- **Florida** remains divided, with local policies varying by county

## Looking Ahead: 2026 Elections

Immigration advocates view the 2026 midterm elections as crucial. **Ana Rodriguez**, from the Cuban American Bar Association, states: *"These policies will be on the ballot. The Cuban community must remember who stood with them during these dark times."*

Polling shows even traditionally Republican Cuban Americans increasingly oppose work restrictions, with **67%** supporting immediate work authorization for asylum seekers.
