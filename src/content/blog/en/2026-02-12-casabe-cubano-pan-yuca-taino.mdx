## The Oldest Bread in the Americas

Long before Christopher Columbus set foot on Caribbean soil, the [Taíno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno) people had spent thousands of years transforming [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava) into a flat, crispy, remarkably durable bread they called **casabe**. This ancient food — possibly the **oldest bread in the Americas** — didn't just survive the conquest: it made it possible.

So central was cassava to the Taínos that their chief deity was named **Yocahu Vagua Maorocoti**, roughly translating to *"Great Lord of Cassava."* In Cuba, casabe has endured five centuries after colonization, and in December 2024 it received the highest recognition possible: [UNESCO declared it Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity](https://apnews.com/article/cuba-casabe-bread-cassava-yuca-food-20a006c5067c297ce7a73c0f958e4724).

## From the Taínos to the Conquest

The Taínos crafted casabe through an ingenious process that remains virtually identical today:

1. **Grate** the bitter cassava using a **guayo** — a wooden board embedded with sharp stones
2. **Squeeze** the grated pulp in a **cibucán** (woven plant-fiber sleeve) to extract the toxic juice containing hydrocyanic acid
3. **Dry** the resulting flour in the sun
4. **Cook** on a **burén** — a clay or stone griddle heated over direct fire

When the Spanish arrived at Hispaniola in 1492, they discovered this *"bread of the Indies"* had an extraordinary advantage: **it didn't go moldy or stale**. Unlike European wheat bread, casabe could last months or even years if kept dry.

This durability made casabe the **perfect ration for expeditions** of conquest. The conquistadors carried casabe from the Antilles to [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire), Venezuela, and across the continent. It's said with good reason that **the conquest of the Americas was powered by casabe**.

## Casabe in Cuba: Camagüey, Capital of Casabe

In Cuba, the casabe tradition found its deepest roots in [Camagüey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey), where **casaberas** — the women who craft casabe by hand — have kept the technique alive for generations.

### The San Juan Camagüeyano Festivals

Every June, during the [San Juan Camagüeyano festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey#Culture), casabe takes center stage. This celebration — dating back to the 17th century — features:

- **Casabera competitions** to craft the largest, most perfect rounds
- **Casabe with guava paste** and cream cheese as the signature festival snack
- **Processions and street parties** where casabe is shared among revelers

### Other Production Centers

Beyond Camagüey, casabe is made in:

- **Holguín** — especially in rural inland communities
- **Guantánamo** — where the tradition blends with Haitian influences
- **Baracoa** — Cuba's first Spanish settlement, where Taíno descendants preserved indigenous traditions longest

## UNESCO Heritage: A Historic Recognition

In December 2024, UNESCO inscribed the **"knowledge, techniques and practices associated with the production and consumption of casabe"** on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The candidacy was jointly presented by five countries:

- 🇨🇺 **Cuba**
- 🇻🇪 **Venezuela**
- 🇭🇳 **Honduras**
- 🇭🇹 **Haiti**
- 🇩🇴 **Dominican Republic**

This recognition doesn't just celebrate a food: it honors an **indigenous knowledge system** that includes cassava cultivation, processing techniques to remove toxins, artisanal tools (guayo, cibucán, burén), and communal preparation practices.

## A Legacy That Transcends Time

Cuban casabe is much more than bread: it's a **direct bridge to the original peoples** of the Caribbean. Every crispy round broken at a Cuban table repeats a gesture performed in exactly the same way for over five millennia.

In an era where *gluten-free* has become a global trend, it's both ironic and beautiful that the Taínos solved that equation thousands of years ago. Casabe didn't need reinventing — the world simply took a while to recognize what the Caribbean's indigenous peoples always knew.

*From the guayo to the burén, from the Taíno to your table — casabe lives on.* 🌺
