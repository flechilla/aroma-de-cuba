On Tuesday, February 11, Cuba reached a grim historic record: **64% of the national territory was without electricity** during peak demand hours, according to official data from the [Unión Eléctrica (UNE)](https://www.facebook.com/LOPEZVIERA1).

## A Record No One Wanted

This figure surpasses the previous historic maximum of 63%, recorded just on January 31. The escalation of blackouts reflects the depth of a crisis that the Cuban government attributes to the US "oil siege," following the January 29 presidential order threatening tariffs on any country supplying oil to the island.

According to [Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2026/02/12/el-regimen-de-cuba-se-hunde-en-una-crisis-energetica-y-economica-sin-la-ayuda-de-venezuela-y-la-presion-de-estados-unidos/), the thermoelectric plants—obsolete and without spare parts—cannot cover even a fraction of the country's needs.

## The Numbers Behind the Collapse

For Wednesday, February 12, the UNE forecasts:

- **Generation capacity:** 1,290 MW
- **Estimated maximum demand:** 3,050 MW
- **Deficit:** 1,760 MW
- **Estimated impact:** 59% of the country during peak hours

Of the 16 operational thermoelectric production units, **6 are out of service** due to breakdowns or maintenance. Among them, two of the three largest in the country.

## Four Weeks Without Distributed Generation

President Miguel Díaz-Canel acknowledged last week that **distributed generation—diesel and fuel oil engines—has been completely paralyzed for four weeks** due to fuel shortage. This source represented approximately 40% of Cuba's energy mix.

As we reported yesterday about the [record 800 MW solar generation](/en/blog/2026-02-12-record-solar-cuba-800-mw/), renewable energy offers partial relief during the day, but is insufficient to cover nighttime demand.

## The Impact on Daily Life

According to [El Nacional](https://www.elnacional.com/2026/02/apagon-masivo-en-cuba-cortes-electricos-afectaran-simultaneamente-a-59-del-pais-este-miercoles/), independent experts estimate that between **$8 billion and $10 billion would be needed** to restore the Cuban electrical system, which has been entirely in state hands since 1959.

Meanwhile, the government has implemented [emergency measures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals/) that include:

- Reduction of hospital services to the bare minimum
- Closure of universities and offices
- Restriction of public transportation
- Gasoline sales virtually suspended

The energy crisis has also been the trigger for the main protests in Cuba in recent years.
