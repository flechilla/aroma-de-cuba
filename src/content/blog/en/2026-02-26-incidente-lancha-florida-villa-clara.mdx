Cuba's Ministry of the Interior (Minint) reported this Wednesday a serious incident in Cuban territorial waters that resulted in the death of four people. According to the official statement, border guard forces intercepted a speedboat with Florida, USA registration, which allegedly attempted an "infiltration for terrorist purposes."

### Details of the Incident in Villa Clara

The operation took place northeast of **Cayo Falcones**, in the municipality of Corralillo, Villa Clara province. Cuban authorities detected the vessel, identified with registration number **FL7726SH**, one nautical mile off the coast.

According to the government's version, 10 armed individuals were on board the boat. During the interception maneuver, a clash occurred in which Cuban agents opened fire, causing the death of four crew members. The other six individuals were detained and are currently under investigation.
