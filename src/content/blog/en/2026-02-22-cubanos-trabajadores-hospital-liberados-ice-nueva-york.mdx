faq:
  - question: "Who are Alex González and Yan Vázquez?"
    answer: "They are a gay Cuban couple living in the Syracuse, New York area. Both worked in the environmental services department at SUNY Upstate Medical University — Alex as a supervisor and Yan as a janitor. They married in the U.S. last year and own a home in North Syracuse."
  - question: "Why were they detained by ICE if they had pending asylum cases?"
    answer: "Both men had active asylum applications and had passed the credible fear interview — a formal legal requirement confirming a genuine threat to their safety in Cuba. Nevertheless, when they appeared for a routine immigration check-in appointment in October 2025, they were detained on the spot and transferred to the Batavia Federal Detention Center near Buffalo, New York."
  - question: "Why were they ordered deported to Ecuador — a country they had never visited?"
    answer: "An immigration judge ordered their deportation to Ecuador as a third-country destination, which the Trump administration has used when Cuba does not accept certain deportees. Alex and Yan argued that they would face persecution in Ecuador — as gay men, just as in Cuba — violating basic international refugee law. Their cases are under appeal."
  - question: "How were they released from ICE detention?"
    answer: "Two labor unions — United University Professions (UUP) and Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) Local 615 — raised money among their members to cover bond: $5,000 for Yan and $15,000 for Alex, plus legal fees. Both men were released with ankle monitors while their appeals remain pending."

After four months locked inside a federal immigration detention facility, **Alex González and Yan Vázquez** — a gay Cuban couple who worked at one of central New York's most prominent university hospitals — walked free, thanks to the solidarity of their colleagues and labor unions.

Their story has become a symbol of the bureaucratic brutality thousands of Cubans face in the United States: they came seeking protection, followed every legal step, and still ended up behind fences.

## A Routine Check-In That Became a Nightmare

Alcibiades "Alex" Lazaro Ramírez González and Yannier Vázquez Hidalgo arrived in the United States from Cuba separately. They met, fell in love, and married last year. They bought a house in North Syracuse and found jobs at **SUNY Upstate Medical University** — Alex as a supervisor in the environmental services department, Yan as a janitor in the same unit.

Both had active asylum applications and had passed the **credible fear interview**, a formal legal threshold establishing that a genuine threat to their safety exists in Cuba. Everything appeared to be proceeding through legal channels.

In October 2025, they showed up to a routine immigration check-in appointment — something many migrants do periodically to demonstrate compliance with the process. They did not come home that night. Federal agents detained them on the spot and transferred them to the **Batavia Federal Detention Center**, outside Buffalo.

## Ordered to a Country They Had Never Visited

What followed was even more bewildering. In January 2026, two separate immigration judges ordered their deportation to **Ecuador** — a country neither man had ever set foot in.

The reasoning: the Trump administration has increasingly used third countries as deportation destinations when Cuba refuses to accept certain migrants or when federal officials identify alternative consular ties. In this case, Alex and Yan's attorneys argued their clients would face persecution in Ecuador — just as in Cuba — for being gay, a violation of basic international refugee law.

Their cases are now under **federal appellate review**.

## The Unions Said Enough

The SUNY Upstate community refused to stay silent. Colleagues, activists, and representatives from two powerful unions mobilized immediately:

- **United University Professions (UUP):** the union representing employees of the SUNY system
- **Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) Local 615:** which represents service workers like Alex and Yan

Together, they raised **$20,000 in bond payments** — $5,000 for Yan and $15,000 for Alex — and also covered their immigration attorneys' fees.

On February 18, Alex walked out of the Batavia detention center. Federal agents drove him to the end of the facility's driveway and dropped him off on the street, where family was waiting: his aunt Miriam del Carmen Andrés and his cousin Jesús Manuel Gorra.

Yan had been released the previous day under similar conditions.

**Both men now wear ankle monitors** and face movement restrictions while their appeal proceeds.

"Their release reflects what can happen when a community comes together and refuses to stay silent," said Ali Cotrell, president of CSEA Local 615. "It is a testament to the power of unity, advocacy, and due process."

## A Case That Mirrors a Broader Crisis

Alex and Yan's story is not an isolated incident. It reflects a pattern affecting tens of thousands of Cubans across the United States:

- [Trump's restriction on work permits for asylum seekers](/en/blog/2026-02-21-trump-restringe-permisos-trabajo-solicitantes-asilo) leaves migrants like them without income while they wait for court decisions that can take years.
- The [expansion of ICE detention capacity to 92,600 beds](/en/blog/2026-02-15-ice-expansion-92000-camas-dhs-cierre) increases the likelihood of detention even for those following every legal step.
- The [I-220A class action lawsuit](/en/blog/2026-02-17-i220a-demanda-colectiva-500mil-cubanos) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Cubans live in systemic legal uncertainty.
- The [death of Geraldo Lunas Campos in ICE custody](/en/blog/2026-02-12-geraldo-lunas-campos-homicidio-ice) is a reminder that detention is not merely bureaucratic — it can be lethal.
- The [self-deportation phenomenon](/en/blog/2026-02-13-autodeportacion-cubanos-ice) shows how many choose to leave rather than face years of uncertainty.

## What Can Cubans with Pending Asylum Cases Do?

If you or someone you know faces a similar situation, immigration attorneys recommend:

1. **Do not attend immigration check-ins without legal counsel.** Even though it is a requirement, the current climate makes attorney presence essential.
2. **Apply for a work permit immediately** if you have already waited 180 days — before DHS's new rule takes effect.
3. **Document any persecution threats thoroughly**, especially in cases involving sexual orientation or gender identity, to strengthen the asylum argument.
4. **Connect with support organizations** such as CSEA, UUP, the ACLU, or Cuban immigrant advocacy groups in your area.
