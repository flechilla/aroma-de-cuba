faq:
  - question: "Why is Canada considering humanitarian aid for Cuba?"
    answer: "Canada has deep historical and economic ties to Cuba, including the largest contingent of Canadian tourists on the island. After repatriating more than 27,900 citizens and watching Sherritt suspend mining operations due to the fuel crisis, Ottawa faces parliamentary pressure from the NDP and Bloc Québécois to act."
  - question: "What happened to Sherritt International in Moa?"
    answer: "Sherritt International, a Canadian company with a joint nickel-cobalt operation in Moa (Holguín), temporarily suspended Cuban operations due to fuel shortages caused by the US oil blockade. It signals that even established foreign investments cannot function without energy supply."
  - question: "What threat does Canada face if it helps Cuba?"
    answer: "Trump's executive order threatens tariffs on oil from any country supplying fuel to Cuba. This puts Ottawa in a difficult position: supporting Cuba could be costly given ongoing trade negotiations with Washington."
  - question: "How many Canadian tourists were in Cuba when the crisis erupted?"
    answer: "More than 27,900 Canadian tourists were repatriated when Air Canada, WestJet, Transat, and Sunwing suspended flights to Cuba due to aviation fuel shortages."

The Canadian government confirmed it is **"evaluating options to support Cuba's most vulnerable people,"** according to official statements reported by CBC News. The language is diplomatic, but the context is urgent: more than **27,900 Canadian tourists** have been repatriated in recent weeks, airlines suspended all flights to the island, and now **Sherritt International** — Canada's largest mining company in Cuba — has suspended its operations.

## Sherritt and Moa: The Business Barometer of the Crisis

The **Moa** nickel-cobalt mine (Holguín), operated as a joint venture between Sherritt and the Cuban state company, is one of Latin America's largest nickel exporters. But without fuel, there is no mining. Without mining, there are no hard currency earnings for Cuba.

Sherritt's suspension is more than a business news item: it is a barometer of how far the US oil blockade has paralyzed real economic activity in Cuba. This is no longer just about the suffering of ordinary Cubans — which had [already brought Canadian airlines to a halt weeks earlier](/blog/en/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis/) — but about foreign investment becoming inoperable.

[Canadian airlines sent empty planes to rescue stranded tourists](/blog/en/2026-02-10-aerolineas-canadienses-rescatan-turistas-cuba/) in an unprecedented repatriation operation. The question now is whether Ottawa will take the next step: direct humanitarian aid.

## Ottawa's Dilemma: Solidarity vs. Trump Tariffs

The New Democratic Party (NDP) and Bloc Québécois have pressed Prime Minister **Mark Carney** to send immediate aid and denounce US "aggression." But Washington's pressure is real.

**Trump's executive order** threatens tariffs on oil from any nation supplying fuel to Cuba. For Canada, already negotiating with Washington on multiple trade fronts, that is a significant political and economic cost.

The **Canadian Red Cross** took the initiative, launching its own **emergency appeal on February 18** to raise funds for Cuba — without waiting for Ottawa to decide. A signal that civil society acts where governments hesitate.

## Cuba Caught Between Two Fires

While [Cuban security forces exit Venezuela under US pressure](/blog/en/2026-02-21-fuerzas-cubanas-salen-venezuela-presion-eeuu/), Havana is losing one of its main economic backers. International support — which should come from historic allies like Canada, Mexico, and Europe — is trickling through slowly.

The [humanitarian convoy 'Nuestra América' plans to reach Havana on March 21](/blog/en/2026-02-20-convoy-nuestra-america-ayuda-humanitaria-cuba/) with civil society support from around the world. But that is another month of waiting for a population already enduring 12-plus-hour blackouts.

## What's in Canada's Interest

Beyond solidarity, there is a concrete economic interest: if Sherritt cannot operate, it loses revenue. If Cuba collapses economically, decades of Canadian investment in mining, tourism, and other sectors lose value — or simply disappear. For Ottawa, helping Cuba also means protecting its own long-term business presence.

The Carney government faces a decision that goes beyond diplomacy: it will define what kind of international actor Canada wants to be in a world where the United States uses oil as a geopolitical weapon.
