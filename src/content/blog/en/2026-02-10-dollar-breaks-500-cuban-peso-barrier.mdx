faq:
  - question: "Why did the dollar reach 500 Cuban pesos?"
    answer: "The combination of foreign currency shortages, energy crisis, reduced tourism, and US embargo pressure has driven up demand for dollars in the informal market, far exceeding the government's ability to stabilize the currency."
  - question: "What does this mean for ordinary Cubans?"
    answer: "The purchasing power of the Cuban peso has collapsed. An average salary of 4,500 CUP now equals less than $9 USD, making it nearly impossible to buy imported goods or basic foods sold in foreign currency."
  - question: "Did the government's floating exchange rate work?"
    answer: "Not as expected. Despite implementing a floating rate in December 2025 to reduce informal market pressures, the dollar has continued climbing from approximately 400 CUP to 500 CUP in just two months."
  - question: "How does this affect remittances to Cuba?"
    answer: "Remittances in dollars now have much greater purchasing power in Cuban pesos, but this also fuels inflation. Families receiving remittances have a significant advantage over those who depend only on national currency salaries."

The US dollar hit a historic high this Tuesday, trading at **500 Cuban pesos** in the informal market—just two months after the government implemented a new floating exchange rate aimed at "reducing pressures and irregularities in the informal market."

## A Milestone Reflecting Economic Collapse

The psychological barrier of 500 pesos was broken amid Cuba's worst energy crisis in decades. The national currency has lost more than 95% of its value against the dollar in recent years, turning state salaries—which average about 4,500 pesos monthly—into the equivalent of less than $9 USD.

## The Floating Rate's Failure

In December 2025, Cuba's Central Bank introduced a floating exchange rate for transactions with the private sector, partially abandoning the fixed official rate of 24 pesos per dollar. The measure aimed to:

- Bring the official rate closer to market reality
- Reduce speculation in the black market
- Incentivize remittance flows through formal channels

However, the lack of foreign currency reserves and the deepening energy crisis have nullified any stabilizing effect. The informal market remains the only real option for most Cubans who need access to hard currency.

## Impact on Daily Life

The devaluation has devastating consequences for the population:

- **Imported food**: Many essential products are only available in stores that sell in dollars or MLC (Freely Convertible Currency)
- **Medicine**: Imported medications have become inaccessible to most people
- **Fuel**: Gasoline, rationed and scarce, is priced to reflect the real exchange rate
- **Remittances as lifeline**: Families receiving dollars from abroad have an enormous advantage over the rest

## Government Crackdown Without Results

In recent months, authorities have intensified persecution of informal money changers and black market operators. Arrests, confiscations, and fines have been reported, but these measures have failed to curb demand or stabilize the currency.

The reality is that "as long as there's no domestic production, significant tourism, or foreign investment generating hard currency, no exchange rate policy can work. The problem is structural, not monetary."

## Special Period 2.0

The peso's collapse inevitably recalls the Special Period of the 1990s, when the fall of the Soviet Union left Cuba without its main trading partner. Today, the combination of:

- Reinforced US embargo under the Trump administration
- Loss of oil supplies from Mexico and Venezuela
- Energy crisis with blackouts lasting up to 10 hours daily
- Tourism collapse due to lack of aviation fuel

Has created a perfect storm pushing the Cuban peso toward irrelevance.

## What Comes Next?

With no signs of relief on the horizon, analysts anticipate the dollar could keep rising. The next psychological barrier—600 pesos—could be reached within weeks if the energy crisis isn't resolved.

For the millions of Cubans living on peso salaries, the message is clear: the national currency has stopped functioning as a store of value. The informal dollarization of the economy advances, deepening inequality between those with access to hard currency and those without.
