# Guayabita del Pinar: Cuba's Best-Kept Secret Spirit

If [Cuban rum](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa-marcas-historia/) is the king of the island's spirits, **Guayabita del Pinar** is its hidden crown jewel. This artisanal liqueur, produced exclusively in **Pinar del Río** province, is so unique that nobody dares classify it — it's not rum, not whisky, not brandy. Locals simply call it *"the delicious liqueur of Vueltabajo."*

Made from **wild guayabitas** — tiny fruits the size of an olive that grow in western Cuba's pine forests — this spirit carries over **200 years of history**, a recipe born in tobacco fields that conquered palates worldwide.

## The Guayabita: A Fruit Found Nowhere Else

The guayabita (*Psidium salutare*) is a wild shrub growing between **50 centimeters and 2 meters tall** in the sandy soils beneath Pinar del Río's pine forests. Its fruits are tiny berries — no more than 1.5 cm in diameter — resembling common guava but with an **intense aroma and concentrated sweetness** that makes them irresistible.

As Jacobo de la Pezuela wrote in his *Geographic Dictionary of the Island of Cuba*: *"The guayabita is the size of a cherry, with a smell and taste like Peruvian guava, but sweeter."*

The [Slow Food Foundation](https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/guayabita-del-pinar/) included it in their **Ark of Taste**, recognizing it as endangered global food heritage.

## History: From Tobacco Fields to Bottle

### The Farmer Origins (18th-19th Century)

The story begins in the freezing pre-dawn hours of tobacco harvest season. Pinar del Río tobacco farmers, desperate to warm up during December and January frosts, experimented by macerating fruits and herbs in barrels of sugarcane spirits. An Asturian immigrant named **Genaro Rivera** had the idea of infusing wild guayabitas in brandy with lemon peel, vanilla, mint, and lemon balm.

The result was so remarkable that he set up a roadside stall to sell it.

### Lucio Garay: The Basque Who Built an Empire (1892)

The real revolution came with **Lucio Garay Zabala**, a young Basque born in 1871 in Bakio, near Bilbao. Garay grew up watching txakolí winemaking in the Basque Country and emigrated to Cuba to make his fortune in spirits.

In **1892**, Garay purchased Rivera's formula, perfected it, and founded **Casa Garay** in Pinar del Río city, launching industrial production. The liqueur evolved from a tobacco farmers' drink into a celebrated spirit across Cuba's bars, restaurants, and celebrations.

### The Song That Made It Famous

In the 1990s, beloved Cuban singer **Cándido Fabré** composed *"Guayabita del Pinar,"* popularized by **La Original de Manzanillo** orchestra. The son track became an anthem that spread the liqueur's fame beyond Cuba's borders.

## The Three Varieties

Guayabita del Pinar is traditionally produced in **three versions**:

### 1. Dry (Seca)
- **Character:** Strong, full-bodied, similar to aged rum
- **ABV:** Higher alcohol content
- **Best for:** Straight sipping, connoisseurs

### 2. Sweet (Dulce)
- **Character:** Smooth, fruity, with vanilla and spice notes
- **ABV:** More moderate
- **Best for:** General tasting, dessert pairing, alongside [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-12-cafe-cubano-guia-completa-marcas/)

### 3. Cream (Crema)
- **Character:** Creamy, very sweet
- **ABV:** The lightest of the three
- **Best for:** Cocktails, digestif, gifts

In many traditional bottles, you can find **one or two whole guayabitas floating inside** — a hallmark of authenticity that distinguishes it from any other spirit.

## How to Enjoy Guayabita del Pinar

## A Heritage in Danger

Guayabita del Pinar faces an uncertain future. The wild plant has **dramatically declined** — 50 years ago it grew abundantly in the pine forests, but deforestation, climate change, and lack of cultivation programs have reduced natural populations.

In the 1980s, authorities attempted a planting program with **50,000 guayabita plants** across 20 hectares in Guane, Viñales, La Palma, San Juan, and Los Palacios municipalities. However, production never recovered to historic levels.

Today, organizations like **Slow Food** are working to preserve this heritage. The guayabita's inclusion in the [Ark of Taste](https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/guayabita-del-pinar/) aims to raise awareness about protecting both the plant and the liqueur-making tradition it sustains.

## A Liqueur That Tells a Story

Guayabita del Pinar is far more than a drink — it's a **living document** of Pinar del Río's history. From tobacco farmers warming their cold mornings with wild-fruit spirits, through the entrepreneurial genius of a Basque immigrant, to the son songs that celebrate it — every sip contains centuries of Cuban tradition.

If [rum tells the story of the Caribbean](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa-marcas-historia/) and [cigars the story of tobacco](/en/blog/2026-02-10-habanos-guia-puros-cubanos-marcas/), Guayabita del Pinar narrates the story of western Cuba: land of pine forests, mogotes, and the most hospitable people on the island.

*A spirit worth discovering — before it disappears.*
