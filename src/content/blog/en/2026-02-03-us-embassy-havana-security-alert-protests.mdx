The US Embassy in Havana issued a security alert for American citizens in Cuba or planning to travel to the island, warning about increased **anti-American protests** and the effects of the energy crisis.

## "Government-Sponsored" Protests

In the message, the Embassy warns about increasing protests it considers "sponsored" by the Cuban government and directed against Washington.

The alert includes information about denial of entry to some American citizens upon arrival.

## Blackouts and Fuel Shortages

The notice details the crisis situation on the island:

- **Daily blackouts** across the country, including Havana, that can exceed 24 hours
- Effects on water supply, food and medicine refrigeration
- **Long lines** at gas stations due to fuel shortages
- Limitations on generators at hotels, hospitals, and businesses

## Recommendations for American Citizens

The Embassy recommends:
- Conserving fuel, water, and non-perishable food
- Keeping batteries and phone charge
- Having alternatives for medical devices requiring electricity
- Having a plan for medications needing refrigeration

## Acts of Repudiation Against Mike Hammer

The alert comes days after US Chargé d'Affaires **Mike Hammer** was subjected to acts of repudiation in the cities of Camagüey and Trinidad.

Viral videos show groups of people shouting insults at the diplomat. According to unofficial media, these acts were organized by the Communist Party and Young Communists.

The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs urged Cuba to "immediately cease its repressive acts" and labeled the Cuban government an "illegitimate regime."

For his part, Hammer was ironic about the protesters: "I think they belong to a certain Party," he said, assuring they "do not represent the Cuban people."
