Cuba has announced a package of **emergency measures** unprecedented in decades to face the fuel crisis. The restrictions affect virtually every sector of society.

## The Announced Measures

### Education Paralyzed
- **Universities temporarily closed**
- **Reduced school hours** in primary and secondary schools
- Hybrid classes where possible

### Reduced Work
- **4-day work week** (Monday to Thursday) for state employees
- Mandatory remote work where possible
- Staff reduction in government offices

### Rationed Healthcare
- **Hospitals limiting stays**
- Non-urgent surgeries **postponed**
- Prioritization of emergency services
- Clinics with reduced hours

### Collapsed Transportation
- Havana's bus system **virtually paralyzed**
- Gas stations with hours-long lines or closed
- Mandatory app to get fuel (reportedly not working well)

### Other Sectors
- **Cultural events suspended** (including the Book Fair)
- Banks with reduced hours
- Hotels consolidating guests to save energy

## "Option Zero"

President Díaz-Canel has invoked the concept of **"option zero"** — a survival plan designed in the 1990s for a scenario without oil. It's the first time it's been activated since the Special Period.

According to [CBS News](https://www.cbs19news.com/emergency-measures-hobble-cuba-as-fuel-supplies-dwindle-under-us-pressure/article_16d1f722-d39b-5da9-87bf-e4f9adfed073.html), the government is prioritizing fuel for:
- Agriculture
- Water supply
- National defense
- Critical health services

## The Context

These measures come after the United States [effectively blocked oil supply](/blog/en/2026-02-10-cuba-aviation-fuel-crisis-air-canada-suspends-flights) to the island, threatening tariffs on any country that sends crude to Cuba.

Venezuela, the main historical supplier, stopped sending oil after the January events. Mexico has suspended shipments for fear of US retaliation.

## Human Impact

For Cubans, this means:
- Children with fewer school hours
- Workers with less income (reduced week)
- Sick people waiting for surgeries
- Families without transportation to get around
