# Cuban Natural Cosmetics: Beauty Born from the Island

Cuba smells like jasmine, tobacco, and orange blossom. Long before "natural" and "organic" became global buzzwords, Cubans were already crafting perfumes, soaps, and balms from the plants growing in their courtyards. That tradition lives on today, blending colonial heritage, advanced pharmacology, and Caribbean creativity.

From the legendary [Perfumería Habana 1791](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-havana-perfume-museum) to the entrepreneurs making handmade soaps in their homes, Cuba offers a beauty universe that few outsiders know about.

## Perfumería Habana 1791: Where Cuba Smells Like History

At Mercaderes 156, in the heart of [Old Havana](/en/blog/2026-02-01-restauracion-habana-vieja-patrimonio/), there's a place where time stopped between crystal bottles and centuries-old aromas. **Perfumería Habana 1791** is more than a shop — it's a living museum of Cuba's perfume-making tradition.

Here, artisans handcraft **12 natural essences** that capture Cuba's olfactory identity:

- **Rose, Violet, and Lilac** — classic florals inherited from the colonial era
- **Jasmine and Orange Blossom** — flowers that perfume Havana's courtyards at dusk
- **Tobacco** — the most Cuban essence of all, made from Vueltabajo leaves
- **Vetiver and Sandalwood** — woody notes for masculine colognes
- **Patchouli and Ylang-Ylang** — exotic and long-lasting
- **Lavender and Lemon** — Mediterranean freshness with a tropical twist

Each perfume is blended in front of visitors, poured into hand-blown glass bottles. Prices are surprisingly affordable — between 5 and 15 CUP per bottle — and the experience is unforgettable.

## Suchel Camacho: Cuba's Cosmetics Industry

If Habana 1791 is the artisanal side, [Suchel Camacho](https://www.suchelcamacho.es/) is the industrial one. This **Cuban-Spanish joint venture**, founded in 1990 at the start of the Special Period, became Cuba's leading cosmetics producer.

### What Does Suchel Camacho Produce?

- **Perfumes and colognes** — from proprietary fragrances to licensed production for brands like Valentino, Shakira, and Benetton
- **Shampoos and conditioners** — featuring local ingredients like aloe vera and coconut
- **Soaps** — from everyday bars to premium lines
- **Deodorants and hygiene products** — mass distribution across Cuba
- **Creams and treatments** — facial and body care lines

The Havana-based company has earned [international recognition for its production quality](http://www.procuba.cu/es/content/suchel-camacho-sa), to the point where European brands trust it to manufacture their Caribbean product lines.

## Star Ingredients: What Cuba Gives to Beauty

Cuba is a natural laboratory of cosmetic ingredients. The island offers raw materials that the global industry pays fortunes to source:

### Aloe Vera
It grows wild across Cuba. Used for sunburn relief, skin and hair hydration, and as a base for gels and creams. Cuban grandmothers always have an aloe plant in the backyard — and science has proven them right.

### Coconut
From the [Cuban coconut palm](/en/blog/2026-02-12-coquitos-acaramelados-cubanos/) comes hair oil, skin butter, and milk for artisanal soaps. Cuban virgin coconut oil is especially valued for its purity.

### Honey
[Cuban organic honey](/en/blog/2026-02-12-miel-cubana-organica-tesoro-caribe/) isn't just for eating — it's used in face masks, moisturizing soaps, and hair treatments. Cuba is one of the few countries that produces certified 100% organic honey.

### Tobacco
Yes, tobacco leaves have cosmetic properties. Tobacco extract is used in perfumery (Habana 1791 knows this well) and in experimental antioxidant treatments.

### Medicinal Plants
Cuba has a renowned tradition in **green medicine**. Plants like chamomile, calendula, rosemary, and purple basil are grown in urban organopónicos and used in both pharmacy and cosmetics.

## The New Entrepreneurs: 21st Century Cuban Beauty

With the opening of self-employment, a new generation of Cubans is creating artisanal beauty brands:

### Cándida Belleza Piel
Founded by **Leonardo Torres Jiménez**, this Cuban brand was the [first Cuban beauty company to exhibit at Belleza y Salud](https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2019/10/15/Cuban-beauty-company-first-to-exhibit-at-Belleza-Y-Salud/), Colombia's most important cosmetics fair. They produce a skincare line and a natural hair loss treatment.

### Handmade Soaps
At markets like the **Feria de San José** in Havana and the streets of **Trinidad**, Cuban artisans sell handcrafted soaps made with:
- Coconut oil and [Cuban honey](/en/blog/2026-02-12-miel-cubana-organica-tesoro-caribe/)
- Tropical flower extracts
- Natural Cuban clays
- Ground coffee (a natural exfoliant with a distinctly Cuban aroma)

These soaps cost between $1 and $3 USD and are among the most popular souvenirs for visitors.

## The Pharmaceutical Tradition: Science Serving Beauty

Cuba has a world-class pharmaceutical system — the same one that produces internationally recognized vaccines. That scientific capacity extends to dermocosmetics:

- The **Centro de Histoterapia Placentaria** developed **Melagenina Plus**, a vitiligo treatment that attracts patients from around the world
- Cuban laboratories produce sunscreens, anti-aging creams, and dermatological treatments with proprietary technology
- The **Labiofam** line includes natural repellents and hygiene products based on Cuban research

This combination of pharmaceutical science + tropical natural ingredients is what makes Cuban cosmetics unique.

## A Market with a Future

Cuban natural cosmetics have everything needed to grow: first-rate organic ingredients, a recognized pharmaceutical tradition, skilled labor, and a history that no laboratory can invent.

While the world searches for "clean beauty" and "farm to face" products, Cuba has been doing it for centuries — it just needed the marketing. That moment is arriving.
