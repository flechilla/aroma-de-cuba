The **Zapata Swamp** (Ciénaga de Zapata) isn't just the largest wetland in the Caribbean — it's one of Cuba's most biodiverse ecosystems and an ecotourism destination that remains blissfully under the radar. Located on the southern coast of Matanzas Province, this vast expanse of mangroves, lagoons, and tropical forests covers more than **4,000 km²** of virtually untouched territory.

While tourists crowd into [Varadero](/en/blog/alertas-viajeros-cuba-tensiones-eeuu/) and Havana, the Zapata Swamp offers something radically different: **raw nature, silence, and encounters with species found nowhere else on Earth**.

## An Unmatched Ecosystem

The Zapata Swamp is a **UNESCO Biosphere Reserve** and a [Ramsar](https://www.ramsar.org/) Wetland of International Importance. Its ecological diversity is staggering:

- **Over 230 bird species**, including the **Zapata Rail** (*Cyanolimnas cerverai*), found exclusively in this wetland
- **The Cuban crocodile** (*Crocodylus rhombifer*), the Caribbean's most endangered reptile
- **More than 1,000 plant species**, with 78 endemic to the territory
- **Manatees, hutias, and manjuarí** — the latter a primitive fish considered a living fossil

The variety of habitats — from coastal mangroves to semi-deciduous forests, flooded grasslands, and coral reefs — creates an ecological mosaic unique in the Western Hemisphere.

## What to Do in the Zapata Swamp

### World-Class Diving and Snorkeling

The Swamp's coastal zone boasts **four internationally certified dive centers** and eleven dive sites. The crystal-clear waters of Playa Girón and the Bay of Pigs feature coral walls dropping vertically over 300 meters.

Top sites include:
- **Punta Perdiz**: shore-accessible snorkeling with abundant marine life
- **Cueva de los Peces**: a natural cenote 70 meters deep, connected to the sea
- **Playa Girón coral wall**: spectacular dives for certified divers

### Birdwatching

With over 230 recorded species, the Swamp is **Cuba's premier birdwatching destination**. The **Bermejas** and **Las Salinas** wildlife refuges are essential stops for spotting:

- **Cuban Trogon** (Cuba's national bird)
- **Bee Hummingbird** (the world's smallest bird)
- **Zapata Wren** (*Ferminia cerverai*), exclusive to this swamp
- Dozens of migratory species from November through April

### Boca de Guamá Crocodile Farm

The **Cuban crocodile** breeding center is a must-visit. This reptile, endemic to Cuba, survives only in the Zapata Swamp and the Isle of Youth. The conservation program has successfully increased the captive population and conducts controlled releases into the wild.

### Laguna del Tesoro (Treasure Lagoon)

Accessible by boat from Boca de Guamá, this freshwater lagoon is Cuba's largest. On its islands sits the **Taíno Village**, a recreation of an indigenous settlement featuring life-size sculptures by Cuban artist [Rita Longa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Longa).

## Where to Stay

### Playa Larga
The northern gateway to the Swamp. Plenty of **casas particulares** (private homestays) for $25-40 USD per night. Ideal for combining beach, diving, and wetland excursions.

### Playa Girón
At the southern end of the Bay of Pigs. The **Hotel Playa Girón**, recently renovated by the Cubanacán group, now operates as **all-inclusive** — a new development allowing guests to combine comfort with nature excursions.

### Boca de Guamá
**Villa Guamá**, built on islets in Laguna del Tesoro, offers a unique accommodation experience surrounded by nature.

## Getting There and Around

The Swamp is **170 km from Havana** (~2.5 hours) and **60 km from Varadero** by road. Options:

- **Rental car or taxi**: the most flexible way. The road from the National Highway is in good condition
- **Viazul**: tourist bus service with stops at Playa Larga and Playa Girón
- **Organized day trips**: multiple agencies in Havana and Varadero offer excursions

Within the Swamp, many excursions require a mandatory local guide — which is actually a plus: guides are wildlife experts who know the best spots.

## TURNAT 2026: The Swamp on the World Stage

In **September 2026**, the Zapata Swamp will host **TURNAT**, Cuba's most important international event for nature tourism promotion. This fifteenth edition will spotlight the destination's renovated attractions and new ecotourism circuits.

## Practical Tips

- **Sunscreen and insect repellent**: essential. Mosquitoes are aggressive, especially at dawn and dusk
- **Closed-toe shoes**: for trails and mangrove areas
- **Cash**: few electronic payment options outside hotels
- **Book guides in advance**: especially for specialized birdwatching and diving
- **Bring water and snacks**: dining options are limited outside Playa Larga and Playa Girón

*The Zapata Swamp is one of those places that remind you why Cuba remains unique in the world. It's not a postcard paradise — it's something better: a living, complex, and fascinating ecosystem waiting for those curious enough to explore it.*
