U.S. migration policy toward Cuba has entered an aggressive and unprecedented phase in early 2026. Under the Donald Trump administration, what was once exceptional treatment has been transformed into a system of accelerated deportations, where new official rhetoric presents a drastic choice for thousands of Cubans: prolonged detention or "voluntary" return to the island.

Recent reports, including analysis from *EL PAÍS* and flight tracking data, confirm that ICE-operated deportation flights have returned to a bi-weekly frequency, with over 300 Cubans sent back so far this year.

## The Strategy of Return Under Pressure

"Maybe they want to go back. They’re going to have that choice," have been the words summarizing the White House's 2026 approach. This "choice" is presented in a context where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is massively expanding its detention center capacity, projecting a reach of 92,000 beds.

For Cubans with final orders of removal (I-220B) or those whose asylum cases have been denied, the message is clear: supervised release is running out. The administration is using the threat of indefinite jail time as a persuasion tool for migrants to accept returning to a Cuba plagued by its worst energy and economic crisis in years.

## Key Changes in Repatriation Agreements

A determining factor in this escalation is the shift in the Havana regime's stance. For the first time in decades, Cuba has begun accepting the return of ex-convicts with serious crimes committed in U.S. territory—a category of people previously systematically rejected, becoming so-called "non-deportables."

This tacit or explicit agreement allows ICE to clear the records of thousands of backlogged cases, using charter flights that now land regularly at José Martí International Airport.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Who is at the highest risk of deportation this month?
Cubans with a final order of removal (Form I-220B), especially those with criminal records, are ICE's number one priority. Those who entered illegally and lost their credible fear cases are also under close watch.

### 2. What does the "optional" return proposed by Trump mean?
It is not a benefit, but a pressure tactic. Migrants are suggested to accept voluntary departure to avoid being held in high-security detention centers indefinitely while their formal expulsion is processed.

### 3. How does the recent Atlanta I-220A ruling affect these deportations?
The recent ruling from the Eleventh Circuit provides a legal reprieve, forcing a review of cases that were previously blocked. This offers a temporary pause for those with an I-220A (without a removal order) but does not protect those who already have a final court order for deportation.

### 4. Are deportations taking place through the Guantanamo Base?
There have been reports of using the Guantanamo Naval Base to process small groups of deportees before their handover to Cuban authorities at the land border, a route that adds significant psychological weight to the process.

## Conclusion

2026 marks the definitive end of the "migratory tolerance" era for the Cuban diaspora in an irregular situation. The combination of a federal judiciary reviewing technicalities (as in the I-220A case) and an executive administration determined to clear removal logs has created a high-alert scenario. For thousands, the legal battle in immigration courts is now the only barrier between their life in the U.S. and a forced return.
