A **Habano** isn't simply a cigar — it's the result of centuries of tradition, a unique climate, and the knowledge of generations of Cuban cigar rollers. Considered the finest in the world, Cuban cigars are synonymous with luxury, celebration, and the art of taking life slowly.

## What Makes a Habano Special?

### Cuban Terroir
The **Vuelta Abajo** region in Pinar del Río has unique conditions: perfect soil, humidity, and temperature for tobacco. It's the equivalent of Champagne for wines.

### Artisanal Craftsmanship
Each Habano is hand-rolled by expert **torcedores**. A senior roller can produce between 60 and 150 cigars daily, depending on the format.

### Quality Control
Only cigars that pass rigorous inspections carry the **Protected Designation of Origin** "Habanos."

## The Great Brands

### Cohiba 🏆
The most prestigious brand, created in 1966 originally for Fidel Castro and diplomats.

**Try:** Cohiba Siglo II (petit corona format, ideal for beginners)

### Montecristo
The world's best-selling brand. Balanced flavors, perfect for any occasion.

**Try:** Montecristo No. 4 (the best-selling cigar on the planet)

### Romeo y Julieta
Founded in 1875, famous for medium-bodied cigars. Winston Churchill was a declared fan.

**Try:** Romeo y Julieta Short Churchill

### Partagás
Intense, earthy flavors. For experienced smokers.

**Try:** Partagás Serie D No. 4

### Hoyo de Monterrey
Smooth and aromatic, excellent for beginners.

**Try:** Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure No. 2

## How to Choose Your First Habano

1. **Start mild** — Hoyo de Monterrey or Romeo y Julieta
2. **Short format** — 30-45 minutes of smoking is enough to start
3. **Buy from authorized stores** — avoid counterfeits

## Where to Buy Authentic Habanos

> ⚠️ **Note:** The sale of Cuban cigars is restricted in the United States due to the embargo. Check your country's regulations before purchasing.

## How to Store Them

Habanos require **65-70% humidity** and **16-18°C (61-64°F)**. Without a humidor, they dry out in days. Invest in a good Spanish cedar humidor — it's essential.

## The Smoking Ritual

1. **Cut** the head with a quality cigar cutter
2. **Light** with cedar matches or butane lighter (never gasoline)
3. **Don't inhale** — the smoke is savored in the mouth
4. **Take your time** — a good cigar deserves 45-90 minutes
