## A Victory That Came Down to the Final Out

Cuba's national team clinched the last semifinal spot at the **2026 Serie de las Américas** after defeating Colombia's Caimanes de Barranquilla 8-7 at the Fórum stadium in La Guaira, Venezuela, on Wednesday night, February 11.

It was a game Cuba dominated for seven innings but that turned dramatically tense at the end, with a ninth-inning finish that tested every nerve on the Cuban bench.

## Despaigne and Cuba's Offense Struck Early

From the opening innings, Cuban bats punished Colombian starter **Yoryi Simarra**. Veteran slugger **Alfredo Despaigne** hit an RBI single and then a **home run** to put Cuba ahead early, while **Yoelquis Guibert** added another key hit.

Colombian reliever **Henderson Álvarez** couldn't stop the bleeding either: **Harold Vázquez** crushed a homer with a runner on in the fourth, and **Yoel Yanqui** followed with another two-run blast in the fifth.

By the end of the fifth inning, Cuba held a comfortable lead and seemed headed for a smooth victory.

## The Ninth Inning That Froze Everyone

But the Serie de las Américas doesn't do easy games. Colombia fought back hard, and in the bottom of the ninth, **Jesús Marriaga** — who drove in five runs on the night — led a rally that put the tying run on base.

With reliever **Yunier Batista** failing on the mound, manager **Germán Mesa** called on right-hander **José Miguel Rodríguez** as an emergency closer. With runners in scoring position and one out to get, Rodríguez **struck out Kelvin Meleán** to seal a save worth its weight in gold.

## Cuba vs. Venezuela: The Semifinal

Cuba finished the qualifying round in **third place** with a 3-3 record, setting up a semifinal clash against host team **Navegantes de Magallanes** of Venezuela, who finished second. The semifinal game takes place Thursday, February 12.

The matchup promises to be electric: Venezuela has home crowd support and a solid roster, while Cuba arrives with the emotional momentum of a hard-fought qualification and the experience of battle-tested players like Despaigne.

## A Sporting Respite in Difficult Times

Amid the [severe energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-11-guiteras-power-plant-fails-2000-mw-deficit/) and [emergency measures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-emergency-measures-universities-hospitals/) gripping the island, the Cuban team's performance in Caracas offers a moment of joy and pride for the millions of Cubans following the tournament from home — many of them without electricity for hours at a time.

Baseball has always been more than a sport in Cuba. It's identity, tradition, and in moments like these, hope.
