# Cuban Beer: From La Tropical to Bucanero, a Refreshing History

Cuba isn't just [rum](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa-marcas-historia/), [coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-12-cafe-cubano-guia-completa-marcas/), and [cigars](/en/blog/2026-02-10-habanos-guia-puros-cubanos-marcas/). The island has a brewing tradition dating back to 1841, when the first Cuban entrepreneurs tried making beer from sugarcane juice. The experiment failed, but the seed was planted.

Today, Cuban beer is an essential part of daily life: from corner bars to family parties, there's always an ice-cold **Cristal** or **Bucanero** waiting.

## The History: From Jamaican Contraband to National Industry

Beer arrived in Cuba as contraband from Jamaica before the British took Havana in 1762 and legalized its import. For over a century, Cubans drank imported beer.

Everything changed in 1888, when increased import taxes drove local production. **La Tropical**, in Puentes Grandes (Havana), became the pioneering brewery. While its early beers were mediocre, hiring French and German master brewers transformed the quality.

The effort paid off: **La Tropical won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1912**, putting Cuba on the global beer map. By 1958, La Tropical and its brands (Cristal, Tropical, Tropical 50) controlled nearly 60% of the Cuban market.

> **Fun fact:** Cuba's record per-capita beer consumption was set in 1952 at 25.6 liters per person per year.

## The Major Cuban Beer Brands

### Cristal 🟢

The undisputed queen of Cuban beers. Produced by [Cervecería Bucanero S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervecer%C3%ADa_Bucanero) in Holguín, it's a crisp lager at **4.9% ABV**.
