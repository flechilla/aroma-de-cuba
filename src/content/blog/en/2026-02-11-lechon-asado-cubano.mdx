faq:
  - question: "How long does it take to roast a Cuban lechón?"
    answer: "It depends on the weight: a 20-25 pound pig takes 4-5 hours in a caja china, or 6-8 hours on a traditional spit. The key is maintaining low, consistent heat for juicy meat and crispy skin."
  - question: "What is the best marinade for Cuban roast pig?"
    answer: "Mojo criollo is essential: crushed garlic, sour orange juice, cumin, oregano, olive oil, and salt. It's injected into the meat and applied externally 24-48 hours before roasting for maximum flavor."
  - question: "Why is roast pig traditional for Cuban Christmas Eve?"
    answer: "The tradition comes from Spain, where roasted suckling pig was a Christmas dish. In Cuba, it adapted to the tropical climate and became the centerpiece of Nochebuena (Christmas Eve) dinner, symbolizing abundance and celebration."
  - question: "What is a caja china and how does it work?"
    answer: "The caja china (La Caja Asadora) is a Cuban roasting method where the pig is placed in a metal box with charcoal on top, cooking through heat conduction from above. It produces crispier skin in less time than traditional methods."

When the aroma of roasting lechón fills the air, every Cuban knows it's time to celebrate. Whether it's **Nochebuena** (Christmas Eve), **New Year's**, or any respectable family gathering, the roast pig is the undisputed king of the Cuban table—the dish that makes distant cousins appear and neighbors peer over the fence.

## A Tradition with Deep Roots

Lechón asado arrived in Cuba with Spanish colonizers, who brought both the Iberian pig and the custom of roasting it for celebrations. But on the island, the tradition transformed. The tropical climate, abundance of citrus, and African influence created something new: **lechón a la criolla**, marinated in mojo and slow-roasted until the skin becomes irresistibly crispy.

> "In Cuba, lechón isn't just food. It's the perfect excuse for the whole family to gather, tell jokes, argue about politics, and end up dancing." — Cuban saying

[Cuban Nochebuena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nochebuena) without lechón is like Havana without the Malecón: technically possible, but inconceivable. And although there are now countless ways to prepare it, the ritual remains the same: the men gather early around the fire, the women prepare the side dishes, and the children wait impatiently for the chance to taste the first piece of crispy skin.

## Mojo Criollo: The Soul of the Lechón

Without [mojo criollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(sauce)), there is no Cuban lechón. This magical marinade transforms a simple pig into a flavor explosion that perfumes the meat from the inside out.

### Traditional Mojo Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 15-20 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 cup sour orange juice (or half orange, half lime juice)
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: 1 grated onion

**Preparation:**
1. Crush the garlic with coarse salt in a mortar until it forms a paste.
2. Add cumin, oregano, and pepper. Mix well.
3. Gradually incorporate the sour orange juice.
4. Add olive oil and mix vigorously.
5. Let rest 30 minutes before using to allow flavors to meld.

### The Marinating Technique

The secret lies in time and technique:

1. **Inject the mojo** deeply throughout the meat using a kitchen syringe. Every 3-4 inches, inject generously.
2. **Score the skin** in a diamond pattern, without cutting through to the meat.
3. **Rub mojo over the entire surface**, especially into the cuts.
4. **Refrigerate 24-48 hours**, turning occasionally. The longer, the more flavor.

## Roasting Methods: From Fire to Caja China

### The Traditional Spit (La Púa)

The ancestral method: the pig skewered on a metal rod, slowly rotating over charcoal embers.

**Advantages:** Authentic smoky flavor, connection to tradition.
**Disadvantages:** Requires 6-8 hours of constant attention.
**The trick:** Keep the embers on the sides, not directly below, to prevent dripping fat from causing flare-ups.

### The Caja China (La Caja Asadora)

A Cuban invention that revolutionized roasting: a metal box where the pig cooks from above with charcoal.

**Advantages:** Faster cooking (4-5 hours), incredibly crispy skin, less attention required.
**Disadvantages:** Less traditional smoky flavor.
**The trick:** During the last 30 minutes, flip the pig skin-side up and add more charcoal for the "final toast."

### In the Oven (Urban Adaptation)

For those without a backyard or caja china:

**Temperature:** 325°F (165°C)
**Time:** 3-4 hours for a 10-12 pound leg
**The trick:** During the last 30 minutes, raise to 425°F (220°C) to crisp the skin.

## The Complete Recipe: Lechón for 15-20 People

### Ingredients

- 1 whole pig, 40-50 pounds (or 2 legs, 12-15 pounds each)
- 3 cups mojo criollo
- Coarse salt to taste
- Banana leaves or aluminum foil for covering

### Preparation (24-48 hours before)

1. Clean the pig thoroughly, removing any remaining hair with a torch or razor.
2. Dry the skin completely with paper towels.
3. Apply the marinade as described above.
4. Refrigerate uncovered for the last 12 hours to dry the skin (key for crispiness).

### Roasting Day

1. Remove the pig from refrigerator 2 hours before to bring to room temperature.
2. Rub coarse salt all over the skin.
3. Place in the caja china skin-side down.
4. Cover with lit charcoal and maintain constant temperature.
5. At 3 hours, check internal temperature (should reach 160°F/71°C).
6. Flip skin-side up for the final crisping.
7. Let rest 20-30 minutes before carving.

## Traditional Accompaniments

A lechón asado isn't complete without its supporting cast:

| Side Dish | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Moros y Cristianos](/en/blog/2026-02-11-moros-y-cristianos/)** | Rice with black beans, the perfect complement |
| **Yuca con mojo** | Boiled cassava bathed in hot mojo |
| **Tostones** | Twice-fried green plantains |
| **Avocado salad** | Avocado, onion, and lime |
| **Maduros** | Sweet caramelized ripe plantains |

## Where to Try Authentic Lechón in Cuba

If you visit the island:

- **Restaurante La Fontana** (Havana): First-class lechón in elegant surroundings
- **El Aljibe** (Miramar, Havana): Famous for chicken, but the lechón holds its own
- **Casas particulares**: Ask your host to source fresh country pig

## In the Diaspora: Keeping the Tradition Alive

In Miami, Tampa, and other cities with Cuban communities, the lechón tradition thrives. Every Nochebuena, backyards in Hialeah fill with the unmistakable aroma of roasting pig, connecting Cuban exiles with their roots.

Stores like [Sedano's](https://www.sedanos.com/) and [Presidente Supermarkets](https://www.presidentesupermarkets.com/) sell whole pigs and pre-marinated legs for those who prefer to skip the marinade step. But purists insist: the mojo must be made at home.
