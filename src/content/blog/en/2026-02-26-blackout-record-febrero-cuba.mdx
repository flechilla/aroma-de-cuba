The energy crisis in Cuba reached a new critical point this Thursday, February 26, 2026. The National Electrical Union (UNE) announced that the electricity generation deficit will hit 1,790 megawatts (MW) during peak hours, meaning more than half of the country will simultaneously remain without power.

## Critical State of the National Electrical System
The UNE's daily report specifies that imported fuel shortages and technical failures at major thermoelectric power plants (CTE) are the primary causes of this alarming figure. Several key units are currently offline for maintenance or emergency repairs following critical breakdowns earlier this month.

Blackouts have lasted for over 12 hours in diverse provinces, impacting households and critical services like food refrigeration, water pumping, and the operation of small private businesses that can no longer afford fuel for their generators.

### Widespread Hardship and Frozen Aid
In Havana, scheduled power cuts have become more frequent and prolonged, while the situation in the island's interior is even more desperate. The suspension of UN humanitarian aid due to the extreme local diesel shortage has deepened the public's perception of an imminent collapse.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why are there so many blackouts in Cuba today?
The energy deficit is primarily caused by a severe shortage of imported fuel and the decaying state of the power plants due to lack of investment and regular maintenance over many years.

### What is the electricity deficit today?
The UNE has projected a peak-hour deficit of 1,790 MW for this Thursday, February 26.

### Which provinces are most affected?
While the entire island experiences power cuts, provinces such as Holguín, Santiago de Cuba, and Villa Clara report the longest disconnection periods, sometimes exceeding 15 hours daily.

### When will the electrical situation improve?
There is no clear timeline for improvement. The government is banking on the installation of solar parks with Chinese technology, but these still do not offset the collapse of the traditional thermoelectric system at night.
