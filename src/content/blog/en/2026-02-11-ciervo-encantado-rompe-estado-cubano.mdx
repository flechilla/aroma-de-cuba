El Ciervo Encantado, considered Cuba's most important experimental theater group, has officially announced its break from state cultural institutions. The decision marks a historic milestone in contemporary Cuban theater.

## 30 Years of Experimental Theater

Founded on October 20, 1996—Cuban Culture Day—by director [Nelda Castillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelda_Castillo) and actress/theater scholar Mariela Brito, El Ciervo Encantado emerged as a scenic laboratory fusing theater, visual arts, music, dance, and [performance art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art).

The group is characterized by moving away from traditional theatrical language, operating from a blurred frontier where the following coexist:

- Ritual and installation
- [Body art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_art) and happening
- Artivism and staging

> "This 2026, El Ciervo turns 30, and we will celebrate it with the joy of having a genuine body of work, which we will continue sharing and protecting."  
> — Official group statement

## The Break with the State

In February 2026, the collective formally announced its separation from:

- The **Havana Theater Center** (CTH)
- The **National Council of Performing Arts** (CNAE)
- The **Ministry of Culture** (MINCULT)

As a consequence, the group will leave their historic headquarters at Línea and 18, in [Vedado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedado), Havana, a space they occupied for years.

## Context: Years of Censorship

The decision wasn't sudden. The group faced multiple censorship episodes:

**August 2024:** State Security and CNAE banned the premiere of *Acción #14 Las Brujas Uruguay*, directed by Nelda Castillo with stage direction by Lázaro and César Saavedra. Artist Lázaro Saavedra, 2014 National Plastic Arts Prize winner, publicly denounced the censorship.

**July 2024:** The work *Madres* was indefinitely postponed by CNAE, the Ministry of Culture, and State Security.

**April 2023:** The Ministry of Culture prohibited the screening of Cuban filmmakers' works at the group's venue, including *La Habana de Fito* by Juan Pin Vilar and *Existen* by Fernando Fraguela.

## A Singular Poetics

Nelda Castillo developed El Ciervo Encantado from her pedagogical experience at the [Superior Institute of Art of Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Arts_(Cuba)). The collective's work is grounded in rigorous research on the expressive means of the performer.

Among their most recognized works are:

- *Visiones de la cubanosofía* (2005)
- *Variedades Galiano* (2010)
- *Departures*
- *La Célula Fundamental*

In 2025, the piece *La Virgen* became part of the [National Museum of Fine Arts of Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Nacional_de_Bellas_Artes_de_Cuba) collection.

## Reactions in the Cultural World

The decision generated immediate support from the Cuban artistic community.

Theater scholar Habey Hechavarría stated: *"This revolutionary decision not only opens a new chapter for El Ciervo Encantado, but also marks a milestone in Cuban theater history. Whatever its development, the impact on the political imaginary of Cuban culture will be devastating."*

Historian Alina Bárbara López Hernández expressed: *"My respect and admiration for you. Thank you for the lesson in dignity."*

## An Independent Future

The group thanked those who have accompanied them and confirmed they will continue their artistic work autonomously. Although they didn't specify where they will develop their work or how they will operate without institutional support, their statement reaffirms commitment to their art and audience.

El Ciervo Encantado's break represents more than an administrative decision: it's an act of cultural resistance that redefines the relationship between art and power in Cuba.
