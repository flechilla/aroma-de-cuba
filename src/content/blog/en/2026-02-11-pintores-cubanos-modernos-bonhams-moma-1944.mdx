In a historic moment for Cuban art, auction house [Bonhams](https://www.bonhams.com/) has inaugurated an exhibition at its new New York headquarters that reunites—for the first time in over **80 years**—works from the legendary **"Modern Cuban Painters"** exhibition at the [Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2317) from 1944.

## The Moment That Changed Everything

On March 17, 1944, MoMA opened an exhibition that would mark a turning point for Cuban art. Organized by **Alfred H. Barr Jr.**, the museum's founding director, with assistance from Cuban art critic **José Gómez Sicre**, the show introduced American audiences to the masters of the [Cuban avant-garde](https://www.christies.com/en/stories/cuban-modern-and-contemporary-art-collecting-guide-bf66235afaf34a299169996eb3dfe264).

The story behind this exhibition is fascinating: in 1942, Barr and Edgar Kauffman traveled to Havana with funds donated by **Nelson Rockefeller** to acquire works by modern Cuban painters. The result was an exhibition that legitimized Cuba as an artistic powerhouse on the international stage.

## Steinway Hall: A New Temple of Art

The exhibition **"Modern Cuban Painters from Havana to New York"** is presented at Bonhams' brand-new U.S. headquarters, located in the historic [Steinway Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinway_Hall) at 111 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Spanning 42,000 square feet, the neoclassical building designed by Warren & Wetmore—the same architects behind Grand Central Terminal—has been meticulously restored after more than a decade of closure.

## The Masters Reunited

In collaboration with the **Fundación Mariano Rodríguez**, the exhibition brings together works that haven't been seen publicly for decades:

### Wifredo Lam (1902-1982)
The most internationally renowned Cuban painter, Lam fused European Surrealism with Afro-Cuban traditions. His "The Warrior" (1947) is one of the exhibition's highlights.

### Amelia Peláez (1896-1968)
A pioneer of Cuban modernism, Peláez transformed the stained glass windows and wrought iron of colonial Havana into a unique pictorial language. Her "El Bacón" (1942) captures the essence of Cuban identity.

### Mario Carreño (1913-1999)
Known for his dynamic compositions, Carreño contributes "La Diosa del mar" (Goddess of the Sea, 1943), a work celebrating Caribbean sensuality.

### Mariano Rodríguez (1912-1990)
With "El desayuno" (The Breakfast, 1943), Mariano demonstrates his mastery in capturing everyday Cuban life with vibrant modernity.

### Cundo Bermúdez (1914-2008)
His iconic "La barbería" (The Barbershop) was one of the seminal works included in the original MoMA exhibition.

## A Legacy That Transcends

The exhibition presents not only paintings but also archival materials and documents from private collections that offer unique insight into the artistic networks that shaped Cuban modernism at its peak.

As **Lilly Chan**, Managing Director of Bonhams U.S., notes: *"This building enables a more experiential approach to the way we engage with collectors, audiences, and partners—bringing together exhibitions, auctions and public programming in a far more expansive and meaningful way."*
