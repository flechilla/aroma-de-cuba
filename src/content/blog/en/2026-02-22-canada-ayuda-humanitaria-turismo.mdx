The commercial and tourism relationship between Canada and Cuba, historic and robust, is facing its darkest hour. Following the decision by **Air Canada, Sunwing, and WestJet** to suspend much of their operations to the island due to the fuel crisis, the debate in Ottawa has shifted from conventional tourism to **emergency humanitarian aid**.

### From Beaches to Support Brigades
Diplomatic sources suggest that civil organizations and sectors of the Canadian government are preparing assistance packages given the severity of shortages in Cuba. The **Canadian Red Cross** has already received reports on the critical lack of medical supplies in areas that formerly relied on the flow of resources brought by international tourism.

### The Sherritt Crisis and the Mining Link
It's not just tourism at stake. Canadian company **Sherritt International**, which operates the nickel mine in **Moa**, also faces unprecedented logistical challenges. The lack of stable energy supplies threatens to paralyze one of the few remaining sources of foreign currency for the Cuban regime, accelerating talks about a Canadian "support bridge" to prevent a total collapse of shared operations.

### A Retreating Market
Historically, Canada has represented **40% of tourists** visiting Cuba. In 2025, that number dropped to 754,000 visitors. With new warnings from Global Affairs Canada recommending "avoid non-essential travel" to several provinces due to electrical instability, the flow of "aid tourism" (Canadians bringing supplies to local families) has become the only real remaining link between both nations.
