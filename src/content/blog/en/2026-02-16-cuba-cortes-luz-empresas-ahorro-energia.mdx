faq:
  - question: "How long will businesses lose power for non-compliance?"
    answer: "ONURE has mandated a minimum 72-hour power cut for any state or private business that fails to meet its approved electricity savings plan."
  - question: "Which businesses are affected by the measure?"
    answer: "Both state-owned enterprises and private businesses (including SMEs and restaurants) are subject to the rule. Entities that begin the month without an approved consumption plan will also face penalties."
  - question: "What is Cuba's current power deficit?"
    answer: "On February 16, 2026, the projected peak-hour deficit reached between 1,673 and 1,723 MW, with demand exceeding 3,100 MW against only 1,457 MW of available capacity."
  - question: "Why have blackouts worsened in Cuba?"
    answer: "The combination of the U.S. oil blockade, constant breakdowns at aging thermoelectric plants, and fuel shortages has pushed Cuba's electrical grid to unprecedented deficit levels."

In a dramatic escalation of measures to confront its energy crisis, Cuba's **National Office for Rational Energy Use (ONURE)** has ordered **minimum 72-hour power cuts** for any business—state or private—that fails to comply with mandatory energy-saving plans.

## Drastic Measures for an Unprecedented Crisis

The directive, already being enforced in [Las Tunas province](https://www.periodicocubano.com/cortaran-la-luz-por-un-minimo-de-72-horas-a-empresas-que-incumplan-plan-de-ahorro/), requires every business entity to have an approved electricity consumption plan at the start of each month. Those without one—or those exceeding their quotas—face immediate disconnection for at least three days.

The measure aims to free up generation capacity for residential consumers, who are enduring blackouts of up to 20 hours per day in some provinces. According to official sources cited by [CNC TV Granma](https://www.cnctvgranma.cu/15/02/2026/cuba/intensifica-transicion-energetica-ante-la-agresion-economica-de-ee-uu/), the policy will be extended nationwide as part of a comprehensive crisis response strategy.

## A Power Grid on the Brink

Monday's numbers paint a stark picture. According to the [official report from Cuba's Electric Union (UNE)](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-16-u1-e199370-s27061-nid320981-otro-dia-tinieblas-deficit-electrico-cuba-rozara), the country woke up to uninterrupted blackouts that had continued since the previous day:

- **Available capacity at 6:00 AM:** 1,240 MW
- **Demand:** 1,915 MW
- **Projected peak deficit:** up to 1,723 MW

With estimated nighttime peak demand between 3,130 and 3,180 MW, and only 1,457 MW available if all planned units come online, **more than half the country faces blackouts** during hours of highest consumption.

## Aging Thermoelectric Plants

The deterioration of Cuba's thermoelectric fleet compounds the problem. **Simultaneous breakdowns** are reported at the Mariel plant (unit 5), Santa Cruz (unit 2), Felton (unit 2), and Antonio Maceo in Santiago (units 5 and 6). Other plants are undergoing extended maintenance.

**Thermal generation constraints** keep an additional 420 MW offline, while the country's 50 solar photovoltaic parks only contribute during daylight hours, peaking at 800 MW around noon.

## The Bigger Picture: Oil Blockade and International Pressure

These measures come at a critical juncture for Cuba. The [oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration](/en/blog/eeuu-evalua-envio-combustible-cuba/) has severed key supply lines, while [diplomatic negotiations](/en/blog/cuba-crisis-diplomatica-negociaciones-secretas/) proceed amid uncertainty.

Last week, Cuba [set a blackout record with 64% of the country without electricity](/en/blog/apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/), and the crisis has led to hotel closures and the near-total shutdown of public transportation in several provinces.

## What This Means for Cubans

For private businesses—SMEs, restaurants, workshops—a 72-hour power cut can mean devastating losses: spoiled food, halted production, lost customers. For state enterprises, the measure seeks to redirect scarce electricity toward households.

Yet with a deficit exceeding 50% of demand, even the strictest business conservation measures can hardly resolve a crisis with structural and geopolitical roots running far deeper than any single policy can address.
