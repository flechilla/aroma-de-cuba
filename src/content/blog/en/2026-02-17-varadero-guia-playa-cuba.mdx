Varadero needs no introduction. With **over 20 kilometers of white sand** and turquoise waters that rival the Maldives, this peninsula in Matanzas province is Cuba's most visited beach destination and one of the Caribbean's most recognized.

But Varadero is much more than a perfect postcard. Behind the resorts lies a real town, ancient caves, coral reefs, and a history stretching from the Taíno people to the 1950s jet set.

## The peninsula: geography of paradise

Varadero occupies the **Hicacos Peninsula**, a strip of land extending 22 kilometers northeast into the Straits of Florida. It's technically an island, connected to the mainland by a bridge at its southern end.

The beach varies by zone:

- **Streets 1 to 64** (town): More compact sand, local atmosphere, restaurants and casas particulares
- **Central hotel zone**: Wide beaches fronting the major resorts
- **Punta de Hicacos**: The most pristine and tranquil beaches, including **Playa El Patriarca** and **Playa Las Calaveras**

Water temperature ranges from 75°F in winter to 84°F in summer — perfect for swimming year-round.

## Where to stay

### All-inclusive resorts

Varadero has Cuba's largest hotel concentration. Top resorts include:

- **Meliá Internacional Varadero**: Five-star beachfront, recently renovated
- **Iberostar Selection Varadero**: Ideal for families, with multiple pools
- **Royalton Hicacos**: Adults-only premium concept
- **Paradisus Princesa del Mar**: Luxury service with oceanfront suites

Prices range from **$80-300 per night** depending on season and category, all-inclusive.

### Casas particulares

The authentic alternative. In Varadero town (streets 1 to 64), dozens of Cuban families rent rooms. Advantages:

- Prices from **$25-40 per night**
- Homemade breakfast usually included
- Direct contact with local culture
- Freedom to eat wherever you want

Platforms like [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) work in Cuba, though availability can be limited.

## What to do in Varadero

### Beaches and water sports

The obvious choice, but essential:

- **Snorkeling**: Reefs off the coast have living coral and tropical fish. Cayo Blanco is the best spot
- **Scuba diving**: The [Barracuda diving center](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147275-d2321917-Reviews-Barracuda_Scuba_Cuba-Varadero_Matanzas_Province_Cuba.html) offers dives from $35 including accessible shipwrecks
- **Catamaran**: Half-day trips to Cayo Blanco with snorkeling, lunch and open bar
- **Kitesurfing**: Wind conditions are excellent between December and April

### Beyond the water

- **Bellamar Caves**: 30 minutes away in Matanzas, these caves are over 300,000 years old with spectacular stalactite formations. Entry: $5
- **Josone Park**: Green oasis in central Varadero with artificial lakes, restaurants and gardens. Free entry
- **Matanzas**: The "Athens of Cuba" deserves a half-day trip. The [Calixto García Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matanzas) and Yumurí Valley are unmissable
- **Saturno Cave**: Natural cenote perfect for swimming and diving, just 15 minutes from the center

### Nightlife

- **La Comparsita**: Bar-restaurant with live music on street 60
- **Street 62**: Bar and paladar zone with local atmosphere
- **Resort cabarets**: Nightly shows with Cuban music and dance

## How to get there

### From Havana

Varadero is **87 miles east of Havana**, approximately 2 hours by highway:

- **Viazul**: Air-conditioned buses, [from $10](https://www.viazul.com). Depart from the Bus Terminal
- **Shared taxi**: $20-25 per person, faster and more flexible
- **Rental car**: From $50-70/day. Agencies at the airport and hotels
- **Private transfer**: $80-120 for the whole vehicle

### Juan Gualberto Gómez Airport

[Varadero airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gualberto_G%C3%B3mez_Airport) (VRA) receives direct flights from Canada, Europe and Latin America. It's 20 minutes from the hotel zone.

## Practical tips

**Money**: Bring cash (euros or dollars). International cards work at resorts but rarely in town. Exchange offices (CADECA) have limited hours.

**Internet**: WiFi available at hotels and the [street 44 park](https://www.etecsa.cu). Buy ETECSA cards (1 hour ≈ $1) or activate international roaming.

**Sunscreen**: The Caribbean sun is intense. SPF 50+ is essential, and bring your own — it's expensive and hard to find in Cuba.

**Tipping**: At resorts, $1 per service is standard. At casas particulares, not expected but appreciated.

**Health**: Tap water is not safe for visitors. Drink bottled water. Varadero's hospital serves tourists.

## Varadero beyond the resort

The most common mistake is never leaving the hotel. Varadero has a **real town** with its own life between streets 1 and 64. Walking the main street at sunset, eating at a local paladar and chatting with neighbors transforms the experience.

For something more adventurous, combine Varadero with day trips to [Viñales](/en/blog/2026-02-14-valle-de-vinales-guia-completa/) (Cuba's most beautiful tobacco valley) or [Cienfuegos](/en/blog/2026-02-16-cienfuegos-perla-del-sur-guia/) (the Pearl of the South). Both destinations are just a few hours away and offer the perfect contrast to beach life.

*Varadero is the gateway to Cuba's Caribbean, but the whole island is the real destination. Use the beach as your base, and let Cuba surprise you.*
