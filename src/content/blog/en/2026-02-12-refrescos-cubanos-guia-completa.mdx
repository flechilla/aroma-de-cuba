In Cuba, drinking a soda was never just about quenching thirst. It was a social ritual, an everyday luxury, a little piece of bottled happiness. From the brands born before the Revolution to those created to fill the void left by Coca-Cola, Cuban sodas tell the island's economic and cultural story in every bubble.

## Before the Revolution: The Golden Age

Cuba in the 1940s and 50s was a soft drink paradise. Dozens of local brands competed with American giants in a vibrant market:

### Materva (1920)
Created in [Matanzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matanzas), Materva is perhaps Cuba's most emblematic soft drink. Made from [yerba mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate), it has a sweet flavor reminiscent of ginger ale or cream soda. After nationalization in 1960, production ceased on the island. Today it's made by [Cawy Bottling Company](https://cawy.net/) in Miami, where it won *Miami New Times*' Best Local Soda award in 2002.

### Ironbeer (1917)
Born in Cuba with a name that evoked strength and modernity, [Ironbeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironbeer) survived the Revolution by reinventing itself in Miami. Its unique flavor — a fruit blend with spice notes — makes it truly one-of-a-kind. Before 1959, it reportedly outsold Coca-Cola in some Cuban provinces.

### Jupíña
The quintessential Cuban pineapple soda. [Jupíña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupi%C3%B1a) captured the island's tropical essence in every sip. Like Materva and Ironbeer, it's now produced in the United States and remains a diaspora favorite.

### Cawy
A lemon soda that gave its name to the [bottling company](https://cawy.net/) that now produces several of these nostalgic brands from South Florida.

## After 1962: Cuba Without Coca-Cola

When Coca-Cola withdrew from Cuba in 1962 following nationalizations, it left an enormous void. Cuba became one of only two countries in the world (along with North Korea) where Coca-Cola isn't officially sold. The island had to invent its own alternatives.

### TropiCola
Cuba's first answer to Coca-Cola. Fidel Castro himself commented during a visit to Chile in 1971: *"We make Coca-Cola in Cuba, but since we don't have the secret formula, it doesn't taste the same."* TropiCola became a symbol of Cuban self-sufficiency, though its taste was always a matter of debate.

Singer-songwriter [Carlos Varela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Varela_(singer-songwriter)) immortalized the brand in song, finding in TropiCola a symbol of Cuban identity caught between socialism and capitalism.

### tuKola (1980s)
Cuba's most successful and enduring cola. Produced by [Los Portales S.A.](http://www.losportales.cu/) in Pinar del Río (a joint venture with [Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9)), tuKola is sold in 355 ml cans, 330 ml bottles, and 1.5 liter containers. American chef [Andrew Zimmern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Zimmern) has publicly praised its flavor.

The brand won awards at Expocaribe (2002) and FIHAV (2001) for its diet version.

### Najita and Cachito
Other local alternatives that appeared to diversify the offering. Najita with its orange flavor and Cachito as a lighter cola option are part of Cuba's contemporary beverage landscape.

## Malta: A Category of Its Own

[Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta_(drink)) deserves special mention. This dark, sweet, non-alcoholic drink made from malted barley is practically an institution in Cuba and the Caribbean. **Malta Hatuey** — named after the [Taíno chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatuey) — was Cuba's iconic brand. Today [Malta India](https://www.amigofoods.com/malta-india.html) and Malta Goya dominate the diaspora market, but Malta Hatuey still evokes pure nostalgia.

In Cuba, they say malta "raises the dead": it's given to children, the sick, and anyone who needs an energy boost.

## Ciego Montero: Water and Beyond

[Ciego Montero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciego_Montero), known primarily for its mineral water from Cienfuegos, also produces soft drinks. Its Limón line became one of the few accessible options during the hardest times of the Special Period.

## The Current Crisis

Today the situation is dramatic. Since 2023, finding a soda in Cuba has become increasingly difficult and expensive. The brands still in production — tuKola, Tropicola, Ciego Montero — are scarce in stores. What was once an everyday pleasure has become a luxury for many Cubans.

The economic crisis, falling tourism, and production problems have left the island practically without accessible soft drinks. A reminder that even small pleasures can disappear.

## Where to Find Cuban Sodas Today

## A Cuba Libre with History

The [Cuba Libre](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ron-cubano-guia-completa-marcas-historia/) — rum, cola, and lime — is perhaps the world's most famous cocktail. And its history is tied to these sodas. It was once made with Coca-Cola, then with TropiCola or tuKola. Each version tells the story of a different era.

*From Matanzas to Miami, from TropiCola to tuKola, Cuban sodas are more than beverages: they're capsules of memory, bottled nostalgia, and carbonated resistance.*
