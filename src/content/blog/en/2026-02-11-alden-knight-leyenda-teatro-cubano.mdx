On Monday, February 10, 2026, Cuba lost one of the most emblematic figures of its artistic scene. **Alden Knight**, actor, reciter, and presenter who dedicated more than six decades to theater, film, television, and radio, passed away in Havana at 89 years of age after several days hospitalized in intensive care.

## A Camagüeyan with Caribbean Roots

Charles Alden Knight James —his full name— was born on August 15, 1936, in the Florida municipality, Camagüey province. The son of [Héctor Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica), a Jamaican, and Georgina James, a Panamanian of Jamaican descent, he grew up in a humble family that faced economic hardships leading them to move to Guantánamo when he was ten years old.

It was in eastern Cuba where young Alden discovered his calling. He began as a reciter and singer at radio station CMKS Radio Savón, performing with the Sorpresa ensemble and Julito Delgado's orchestra. That precocious talent would years later lead him to conquer Havana.

## Six Decades of Live Theater

Knight arrived in the capital hungry to learn. He took acting classes and gradually made his way among theater, radio, and television directors until winning over audiences. In 1956, he represented Camagüey on a national television program —in those days without videotape, when everything was performed live.

Throughout his career, he participated in **more than one hundred theatrical productions**. At the Teatro Musical de La Habana, he portrayed Mephistopheles, and one of his most remembered performances was in *Sizwe Banzi Is Dead*, where for an hour he played between twelve and fifteen characters completely alone on stage.

He founded the **Tacya** theater group and ventured into musical theater, where he composed his first song: *Amor en Trinidad* (Love in Trinidad).

## The Big and Small Screen

Cuban cinema owes him memorable performances in fundamental films:

- **El otro Cristóbal** (1963)
- **El bautizo** (1968)
- **[El otro Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Francisco)** (1975) — directed by Sergio Giral
- **Una mujer, un hombre, una ciudad** (1978)
- **Lejos de África** (1996)

On television, generations remember him from the series *En silencio ha tenido que ser* and his recent appearances on the program *Entre tú y yo*. Since 1986, he hosted *Hablando de Cuba* on Radio Taíno, a program that maintained high audience ratings for three decades.

## The Poet of Nicolás Guillén

A lesser-known facet of Knight was his dedication to the work of [National Poet Nicolás Guillén](/en/blog/nicolas-guillen-poeta-nacional-cuba/). He recorded an album of poems and calypsos, and together with actress Asenneh Rodríguez created shows that dramatized his verses under the direction of choreographer Luis Trápaga.

This work took them throughout Cuba, and in 1994 they traveled to Spain with the show *De La Habana Vieja Guillén en son* (From Old Havana, Guillén in Son). His interpretation of Guillén's poetry became one of the hallmarks of his career.

## Recognition and Legacy

Honors came steadily:

- **National Television Award** (2009)
- **Alejo Carpentier Medal**
- **Nicolás Guillén Order**
- **Shield of the City of Sancti Spíritus**
- **Mirror of Patience of Camagüey**
- **Replica of Máximo Gómez's Machete**

Knight also took his art around the world: Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Mexico, Nicaragua, Jamaica, Venezuela, Angola, and beyond.

## A Farewell Verse

In one of his poems, *Siempre joven* (Forever Young), Knight wrote:

> *When someone great passes away*  
> *(Keep this in memory)*  
> *Perhaps death desires*  
> *That they live on in history.*

Cuba bids farewell to a complete artist whose legacy will live on in every stage he graced, every verse he recited, every character he inhabited. His voice, his expressive smile, and the vital passion that always emanated from his work will remain in the collective memory of the Cuban people.

*Rest in peace, Alden Knight (1936-2026).*
