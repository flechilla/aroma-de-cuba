A coalition of Hollywood artists, intellectuals, and international organizations has launched the **"Let Cuba Live!"** campaign, denouncing the Trump administration's executive order blocking oil imports to Cuba as a deliberate strategy to cause "mass starvation and human suffering" on the island.

## High-Profile Signatories

The [open letter](https://www.letcubalive.info/) features signatures from prominent figures in entertainment and academia:

**Artists:**
- **Susan Sarandon** - Oscar-winning actress
- **Mark Ruffalo** - Actor known for his role as Hulk in Marvel films
- **Alice Walker** - Pulitzer Prize-winning author

**Academics:**
- **Greg Grandin** (Yale University)
- **Michael Hardt** (Duke University)
- **Andrew Ross** (New York University)
- **Bruce Robbins** (Columbia University)

## The Message

> "Cuba poses no threat to the United States. Starving a population into submission is not diplomacy—it is a form of terrorism."

The signatories describe the oil blockade as "a cynical and crude stratagem to distract public opinion from domestic problems" and warn that, as seen in Venezuela, it could be "a precursor to an illegal military attack."

## Participating Organizations

The campaign has been coordinated by multiple organizations:

- **ANSWER Coalition**
- **The People's Forum**
- **IFCO Pastors for Peace**
- **Movement for Black Lives (M4BL)**
- **Collective 50501**

Manolo De Los Santos, Executive Director of The People's Forum, and Claudia De La Cruz of IFCO Pastors for Peace lead the initiative alongside U.S. local political representatives.

## Crisis Context

The letter comes at a critical moment. Cuba faces:

- **No aviation fuel** - International airlines cannot refuel
- **Power outages up to 20 hours daily** in several provinces
- **Hotels closed** and tourists relocated
- **Schools and universities suspended** to save energy

## Background

This isn't the first "Let Cuba Live!" letter. A similar message was sent to the Biden administration in 2021, though under less extreme circumstances than today.

The campaign seeks to generate international pressure and open public debate about the humanitarian consequences of intensified U.S. sanctions.
