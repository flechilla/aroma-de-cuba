A group of prominent American artists, intellectuals, and social organizations has signed an open letter under the title **"Let Cuba Live!"**, demanding that President Donald Trump end his maximum pressure policy against the island.

## Hollywood Celebrities Speak Out

Among the most recognized signatories are actress **Susan Sarandon**, actor **Mark Ruffalo**, and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer **Alice Walker**. The initiative is also supported by academics from prestigious universities including Greg Grandin (Yale), Michael Hardt (Duke), Andrew Ross (NYU), and Bruce Robbins (Columbia).

The letter denounces Trump's latest executive order, which imposes tariffs on any country supplying oil to Cuba, as aimed at causing "mass starvation and human suffering" on the island.

## "Starving a Population Is Terrorism"

The document is blunt in its criticism: *"Cuba poses no threat to the United States,"* it states, emphasizing that *"starving a population is not diplomacy—it is a form of terrorism."*

The signatories consider this measure "a cynical and crude ploy to distract public opinion" and warn it could be "a precursor to an illegal military attack," similar to what recently occurred in Venezuela.

## Organizations Backing the Campaign

The initiative has the support of numerous social organizations, including:

- **ANSWER Coalition**
- **The People's Forum**
- **IFCO Pastors for Peace**
- **Movement for Black Lives (M4BL)**
- **Collective 50501**

Manolo De Los Santos, executive director of The People's Forum, and Claudia De La Cruz of IFCO Pastors for Peace are among the social leaders who have signed.

## Crisis Context

The letter comes at a critical moment. Since the United States attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, Cuba has seen its Venezuelan oil supply cut off. Trump's subsequent executive order threatening tariffs on countries sending fuel to the island has worsened the situation.

The signatories call on "all people of conscience to reject this cruelty and demand an immediate end to the embargo."

This is not the first time the Let Cuba Live campaign has been activated. In 2021, under the same banner, a similar letter was sent to the Biden Administration.
