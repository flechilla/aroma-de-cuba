faq:
  - question: "What is the origin of the word hammock?"
    answer: "The word hammock comes from the Taíno language, spoken by indigenous Caribbean peoples. It derives from 'hamaca,' linked to the maka tree whose bark was used to weave the first hammocks. Christopher Columbus documented it in his journals from his first voyage to Cuba in 1492."
  - question: "What materials are used in traditional Cuban hammocks?"
    answer: "Traditional Cuban hammocks were woven from henequén (sisal), majagua (sea hibiscus), and cotton fibers. Today they're also made from nylon and polypropylene, though artisans in provinces like Camagüey and Holguín still use natural fiber techniques."
  - question: "Where can I buy authentic Cuban-style hammocks?"
    answer: "In Cuba, artisan markets like San José in Havana and Trinidad's craft market sell handmade hammocks. Online, Yellow Leaf Hammocks, Amazon, and Etsy offer Caribbean-style hammocks. Miami's Cuban shops on Calle Ocho also carry them."
  - question: "How do you properly hang a Cuban hammock?"
    answer: "Hang the hammock at about 5 feet high with a 30-degree angle on the ropes. The distance between anchor points should be about 75% of the hammock's total length. This creates the perfect ergonomic curve for comfortable rest."

## The Cradle of the Gods, Born in Cuba

Long before Christopher Columbus set foot on Cuban soil in October 1492, the **Taíno people** were already sleeping suspended between trees in woven nets they called *hamaca*. That word — one of the first the Spanish adopted from the New World — became universal: *hamaca* in Spanish, *hamac* in French, *Hängematte* in German.

The hammock isn't just furniture. It's one of **Cuba's most important gifts to the world**, an indigenous invention that revolutionized rest in the tropics and forever changed life at sea.

## Taíno Origins: The Maka Tree Root

The Taíno people who inhabited Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Antilles wove their hammocks from the inner bark of the **maka tree** (*Pisonia aculeata*), a tropical shrub abundant across the Caribbean islands. That's where the name comes from.

The earliest Spanish chronicles describe these "hanging beds" with amazement:

> *"Beds that are like cotton nets... they found them to be beds made of things resembling cotton nets"* — Columbus's Journal, 1492

The Taínos also wove them with fibers from **henequén** (*Agave fourcroydes*), **majagua** (*Hibiscus tiliaceus*), and wild cotton. They dyed them with plant-based pigments — red from annatto, black from jagua — and decorated them according to the rank of the cacique or warrior.

For the Taínos, the hammock served purposes well beyond rest:

- **Primary bed** in bohíos (communal houses)
- **Baby cradle**, rocking infants with the breeze
- **Funeral shroud** — the dead were wrapped in their hammock
- **Status symbol** — caciques had more elaborate hammocks

## From Cuba to the World: A Revolution in Sleeping at Sea

Columbus took several hammocks on his first return voyage to Spain, and a quiet revolution began. European sailors — accustomed to sleeping on hard planks on damp decks — discovered that hammocks were perfect for naval life.

The **British Royal Navy** officially adopted the hammock in the 16th century, and for over 300 years it was the standard bed in every European fleet. Each sailor received their hammock upon enlisting and took it when they retired.

The advantages were clear:
- They swayed with the ship's movement, preventing falls
- They took up little space and rolled up easily
- They kept sailors away from rats and floor moisture
- They were more hygienic than shared bunks

And so, a Taíno invention from Cuba's shores ended up equipping the fleets that dominated the world's oceans.

## Traditional and Modern Materials

### Historic Fibers

| Material | Origin | Characteristics |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Henequén** | Cuban agave | Resistant, durable, rustic |
| **Majagua** | Sea hibiscus | Flexible, soft, traditional |
| **Cotton** | Colonial crops | Comfortable, breathable |
| **Hemp** | Imported (18th c.) | Extremely durable |

### Modern Materials

Today, Cuban and Caribbean hammocks are made from:
- **Organic cotton** — the premium option, soft and eco-friendly
- **Polyester** — water and weather resistant
- **Nylon** — lightweight, ideal for travel
- **Polypropylene** — affordable, colorful, most common in Cuba

Artisans in **Camagüey**, **Holguín**, and eastern Cuba maintain the tradition of weaving hammocks with inherited techniques, using hand looms and natural fibers when available.

## The Hammock in Cuban Life

In Cuba, the hammock never stopped being central to daily life. In the countryside — from Pinar del Río to Guantánamo — the **porch with a hammock** is as iconic as the [Cuban rocking chair](/en/blog/2026-02-12-sillon-cubano-mecedora-tradicion/) or the 3 PM cafecito.

### In the Countryside

Cuban farmers still use hammocks for:
- The afternoon siesta after lunch
- Resting during long agricultural workdays
- Sleeping on hot nights (better ventilation than a bed)
- Accommodating guests when there aren't enough beds

### In the City

In Havana and other cities, hammocks appear on:
- **Balconies and rooftops** of colonial buildings
- **Parks and gardens** (the "park hammocks")
- **Casas particulares** and hostels for tourists
- **Beaches** in Varadero, Guardalavaca, and the cays

### In Music and Culture

The hammock appears in countless **sones**, **guarachas**, and **boleros** as a symbol of rest, love, and tropical life. There's no more Cuban image than a hammock strung between [royal palms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roystonea_regia) with the sea in the background.

## Types of Caribbean Hammocks

### Net Hammock (Mesh)

The most traditional, a direct descendant of the Taíno design. Woven in open mesh that allows air circulation — essential in Cuba's heat. This is the one you'll see on rural porches.

### Fabric Hammock

Made from a continuous piece of cotton or canvas, offering more support and comfort. Popular in modern versions and export hammocks.

### Brazilian Hammock

Wider, with wooden spreader bars at each end. Though not originally Cuban, it has become popular on the island for its stability.

### Chinchorro

A Venezuelan and Colombian hammock variant, larger and more elaborate, woven in multiple layers. Found in some areas of eastern Cuba due to cultural proximity with the continental Caribbean.

## How to Choose and Care for Your Hammock

**Choosing:**
- Measure your space (you need 10–13 feet between anchor points)
- For indoor use, choose cotton (softer to the touch)
- For outdoor use, pick polyester or nylon (weather resistant)
- A double hammock is more comfortable even for one person

**Care:**
- Hand wash with mild soap
- Dry in the shade (direct sun degrades fibers)
- Store in a dry place when not in use
- Check anchor points regularly

## A Legacy That Lives On

From Taíno bohíos to rural porches, from Spanish galleons to Varadero's beaches, the Cuban hammock has traveled five centuries without losing its essence: a suspended space for rest, sleep, and contemplation.

Every time someone rocks in a hammock anywhere on the planet, they're using an invention born on the islands of the Caribbean — a gift from Cuba's [Taíno people](/en/blog/2026-02-12-casabe-cubano-pan-yuca-taino/) to the entire world.

*Because in Cuba, resting is an art. And the hammock is its canvas.*
