Mexico has taken a significant step in the Cuban crisis. President **Claudia Sheinbaum** confirmed on Wednesday that **active discussions** are underway to explore whether her country can facilitate a dialogue between the United States and Cuba, amid the worst energy and humanitarian crisis the island has faced in decades.

## "There are talks to see if it's feasible"

"There are talks to see if it's feasible, but it depends on both governments. Not just on the will of the Mexican government, but on the will of Cuba's government and the will of the United States government," Sheinbaum declared during her [morning press conference](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/presidenta-de-mexico-afirma-que-hay-conversaciones-para-mediar-entre-eeuu-y-cuba/).

The statement comes at a critical moment. On one hand, [Marco Rubio has been holding secret talks with Raúl Castro's grandson](/blog/2026-02-18-rubio-negociaciones-secretas-nieto-raul-castro/) according to Axios. On the other, the [U.S. oil blockade](/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz/) has pushed Cuba to unprecedented crisis levels.

## Humanitarian aid: distribution has begun

While diplomatic negotiations take shape, concrete aid is already flowing. According to [AP](https://apnews.com/article/cuba-mexico-crisis-eeuu-petroleo-ac81ff8c8ea57642d2aee6028f834c4a), Cuba began distributing the **814 tons of supplies** that arrived last week aboard two Mexican Navy ships.

Packages include rice, beans, sardines, crackers, tuna, and canned peaches. Cuba's Ministry of Domestic Trade (Mincin) announced that distribution prioritizes:

- Families with children ages 0 to 13
- Adults over 65
- Pregnant women
- Underweight or undersized children
- Vulnerable households

Additionally, over **1,500 tons** of powdered milk and beans remain pending for shipment, according to Mexico's Foreign Ministry.

## Self-determination as guiding principle

Sheinbaum framed Mexico's position within its constitutional foreign policy principles: self-determination of peoples, non-intervention, and peaceful conflict resolution.

"The only ones who can decide Cuba's government are the Cubans. The only ones who can decide Mexico's government are Mexicans. No one else. There should be neither interference nor invasions," the president stated.

She also called on other nations to join the aid effort: "I hope more countries join in. We will continue sending aid and support."

## The Mexican oil dilemma

Mexico's position reveals a clear tension. While Sheinbaum's government openly criticizes Washington's sanctions, it has acknowledged **halting fuel shipments** to Cuba "for now" following Trump's threats.

It's a delicate balancing act: Mexico sends food but not oil, criticizes the blockade but doesn't directly challenge it, and now offers to mediate between two governments with seemingly irreconcilable positions.

## A diplomatic triangle?

Mexico's mediation offer adds to an increasingly active diplomatic landscape around Cuba. In the past week:

- [Trump confirmed Rubio is negotiating directly with Cuba](/blog/2026-02-17-trump-confirma-rubio-negocia-cuba-acuerdo/)
- [Rubio held secret talks with Raúl Castro's grandson](/blog/2026-02-18-rubio-negociaciones-secretas-nieto-raul-castro/)
- [Cuba's foreign minister visited Moscow to meet with Putin](/blog/2026-02-18-canciller-cuba-putin-moscu-crisis/)
- [The U.S. opened the door to private fuel shipment licenses](/blog/2026-02-18-eeuu-envios-combustible-cuba-licencias-privadas/)

The key question is whether Mexico can be a credible interlocutor for both sides. For Washington, Sheinbaum shows pragmatism by halting oil. For Havana, Mexico remains the ally sending humanitarian aid and defending non-intervention.

What's clear is that the Cuban crisis is no longer a bilateral affair between Washington and Havana. It now involves [Russia](/blog/2026-02-10-rusia-declara-situacion-cuba-critica-acusa-eeuu/), Mexico, and potentially other regional actors in a diplomatic game that's only just beginning.
