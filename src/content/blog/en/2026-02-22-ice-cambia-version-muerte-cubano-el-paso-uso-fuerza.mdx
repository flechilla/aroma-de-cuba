In a reversal that exposes the contradictions within the immigration detention system, ICE admitted this week that the death of Cuban national **Geraldo Lunas Campos** at a detention center in El Paso was the result of a **"spontaneous use of force,"** contradicting its own initial account that he had died from "medical distress."

## Three Versions, One Death

The case timeline reveals how the official narrative has shifted repeatedly:

1. **January 3, 2026**: ICE [announces Lunas Campos' death](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-reports-aggravated-felon-and-convicted-child-sex-offenders-death-camp-east), attributing it to "medical distress"
2. **January 15-21**: The [El Paso medical examiner rules it a homicide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/15/ice-detention-death-homicide/) — the first such ruling for an ICE detainee death linked to staff in at least 15 years
3. **February 20**: ICE quietly updates its report, admitting **"spontaneous use of force"** was used to "prevent him from harming himself"

## Asphyxia in Custody

The autopsy determined that Lunas Campos died of **asphyxia from pressure on his neck and chest** while being physically restrained by security staff. Six detainees at El Paso [testified in court](https://www.texastribune.org/2026/01/21/texas-el-paso-immigrant-death-ice-custody-homicide/) that the Cuban man had **begged for days** to receive his asthma medication, but staff refused and threatened him with solitary confinement.

The [ICE report](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_LUNASCampos.pdf) acknowledges that Lunas Campos had a "complex medical and mental health history," including prior treatment for tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, and asthma, as well as previous suicide attempts.

## A 55-Year-Old Father

Geraldo Lunas Campos was a father of three who had lived in the United States for nearly 20 years before his arrest. An immigration judge ordered his removal in 2005, but it was never carried out because the government **could not obtain travel documents** from Cuba. He was transferred to the East Montana camp at Fort Bliss in September 2025.

## The DHS Response

Confronted with evidence presented by [CNN](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/02/19/eeuu/exclusiva-dhs-sitio-web-plagado-errores-trax) and [The Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2026/01/29/texas-el-paso-migrant-death-ice-custody-autopsy-prosecution/), an unnamed DHS spokesperson defended staff actions, claiming Lunas Campos "violently resisted security staff and continued to attempt to take his life."

The official response included a statement that has sparked outrage: *"This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States."*

## Criminal Charges?

Democratic Congresswoman **Veronica Escobar** (El Paso) has visited the Fort Bliss camp more than six times and argues that local prosecutors may have jurisdiction to file charges, as the staff involved appear to be **civilian contractors, not federal agents**.

"This is a moment where we need local law enforcement, local prosecutors to create accountability, because the federal government will not," Escobar stated.

## Part of a Broader Pattern

Lunas Campos' death is not an isolated case. Four migrants died in immigration custody in the first 10 days of 2026, according to official reports. His case adds to an increasingly alarming context:

- **[302 Cubans deported](/en/blog/2026-02-20-segundo-vuelo-deportacion-cuba-116-migrantes-2026)** so far in 2026
- **[Detention bed expansion](/en/blog/2026-02-15-ice-expansion-92000-camas-dhs-cierre)** to 92,600
- **[1,900 Cubans on erroneous DHS list](/en/blog/2026-02-21-lista-dhs-peores-migrantes-errores-1900-cubanos)**
- **[Work permit restrictions](/en/blog/2026-02-21-trump-restringe-permisos-trabajo-solicitantes-asilo)** for asylum seekers
- **[Cuba accepting deportees with criminal records](/en/blog/2026-02-19-cuba-acepta-deportados-delitos-graves-primera-vez)**

The case remains under active investigation. Federal prosecutors have not responded to inquiries about whether ICE's findings could lead to criminal charges.
