The Festival del Habano, the world's most prestigious tobacco industry event, will not take place this February. Cuba announced the cancellation of the 2026 edition, scheduled for February 24-27, amid the worst [energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) the island has faced in decades.

## A Multi-Million Dollar Event Suspended

The organizing committee notified participants by email that the event was postponed with no new date set. The decision directly impacts the country's finances: in 2025, the annual humidor auction raised **16.4 million euros**, funds officially earmarked for Cuba's public health system.

The previous edition set a record when seven humidors from iconic brands like **Cohiba, Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, Partagás, Hoyo de Monterrey, and H. Upmann** fetched over $17 million. The commemorative humidor for Cohiba's Behike Line 15th anniversary sold for €4.6 million alone.

## The Oil Blockade Paralyzes the Island

The cancellation is a direct consequence of the fuel crisis that has paralyzed Cuba. The [US oil blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-sin-combustible-aviacion-air-canada-suspende-vuelos/) has caused:

- **Massive flight suspensions**: Airlines from [Canada](/en/blog/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis/), [Russia](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba/), and other countries have cancelled routes
- **Record blackouts**: up to [64% of the country without power](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/)
- **Ñico López refinery fire**: the [February 13 blaze](/en/blog/2026-02-14-incendio-refineria-nico-lopez-habana/) further worsened fuel supplies

Without regular international flights and with energy infrastructure collapsing, hosting an event that draws thousands of international visitors proved impossible.

## The 2025 Capitol Controversy

The cancellation comes a year after the festival sparked fierce controversy. In 2025, some 600 VIP guests enjoyed a lavish red-carpet dinner at Havana's **National Capitol** while much of the country suffered prolonged blackouts.

Images of the illuminated Salón de los Pasos Perdidos hosting the global cigar elite sparked outrage on social media. Citizens and journalists called it "Cuba's Versailles," denouncing the contrast between opulence and everyday hardship.

## Impact on Cuba's Tobacco Economy

Tobacco remains one of Cuba's most valuable export products. Habanos cigars are recognized worldwide as the finest, and the annual festival is the industry's premier commercial showcase.

The suspension represents not just millions lost in auctions, but also the impact on trade agreements, promotion of new cigar lines, and Cuba's international image as a luxury destination.

With the [UN condemning the energy blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-13-onu-condena-bloqueo-energetico-cuba/) and [Mexican humanitarian aid](/en/blog/2026-02-13-buques-mexico-ayuda-humanitaria-cuba/) as the only relief in sight, the Festival del Habano joins the growing list of casualties in a crisis showing no signs of easing.
