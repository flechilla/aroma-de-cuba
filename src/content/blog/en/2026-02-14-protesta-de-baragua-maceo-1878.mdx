faq:
  - question: "What was the Protest of Baraguá?"
    answer: "It was the act of rejecting the Pact of Zanjón carried out by General Antonio Maceo on March 15, 1878. At the Mangos de Baraguá in eastern Cuba, Maceo told Spanish General Martínez Campos that he would not accept peace without full independence and the complete abolition of slavery."
  - question: "Why did Antonio Maceo reject the Pact of Zanjón?"
    answer: "Maceo believed the pact failed to achieve the fundamental goals of the war: Cuba's total independence and the complete abolition of slavery. Accepting those terms meant betraying ten years of fighting and sacrifice."
  - question: "What is the historical significance of the Protest of Baraguá?"
    answer: "José Martí called it 'the most glorious moment in our history.' It symbolizes the dignity and revolutionary resolve of the Cuban people. It proved the fight for independence was not over and laid the groundwork for the Necessary War of 1895."
  - question: "Who was Antonio Maceo and why was he called the Bronze Titan?"
    answer: "Antonio Maceo Grajales (1845-1896) was Lieutenant General of the Cuban Liberation Army. He was called the Bronze Titan for his physical strength, dark skin, and stature as a military leader. He fought in over 500 battles and received 26 war wounds."

On **March 15, 1878**, at a place called [Mangos de Baraguá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_of_Baragu%C3%A1) in eastern Cuba, one of the most defining moments in Cuban history unfolded. General [Antonio Maceo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Maceo), just 32 years old, stood before Spanish Captain General [Arsenio Martínez Campos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenio_Mart%C3%ADnez-Campos) and delivered a message that would change the course of a nation: **we do not accept this peace**.

It was an act of courage that [José Martí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD) would later immortalize as *"the most glorious moment in our history."*

## The Ten Years' War: A Decade of Blood

To understand Baraguá, you have to go back to [October 10, 1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grito_de_Yara), when [Carlos Manuel de Céspedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Manuel_de_C%C3%A9spedes) launched the Grito de Yara and began the [Ten Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years%27_War) against Spanish rule.

For a decade, the **mambises** — Cuba's independence fighters — battled with machetes, captured rifles, and unbreakable determination. The war claimed more than **200,000 lives** on both sides.

But by 1878, the movement was fractured:

- **Internal divisions** between political and military leaders
- **Exhaustion** after ten years of conflict
- **Lack of resources** and weapons
- **Racial tensions**: many white leaders distrusted the growing influence of Black and mixed-race officers

## The Pact of Zanjón: Peace Without Justice

On February 10, 1878, the [Pact of Zanjón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Zanj%C3%B3n) was signed between representatives of the insurgent government and General Martínez Campos. Spain offered:

- **General amnesty** for all combatants
- **Freedom** for enslaved people who had fought in the mambí army
- **Political reforms** similar to those in Puerto Rico

But the pact **did not** include the essentials:

- ❌ **No guarantee of independence** for Cuba
- ❌ **No complete abolition of slavery** (only for those who had fought)
- ❌ **No real representation** in the colonial government

For most leaders in eastern Cuba — where the war had been fiercest and where the Black and mixed-race population was the majority — this peace was a betrayal.

## The Meeting at Mangos de Baraguá

Martínez Campos, confident he could convince Maceo as he had convinced others, requested a meeting. It was set for **March 15, 1878** at Mangos de Baraguá, near [Santiago de Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba).

Maceo arrived with his officers. Martínez Campos came with his staff and an interpreter — a telling detail, since Maceo spoke perfect Spanish. The Spanish general expected a negotiation; what he got was a declaration.

### The Words That Changed History

Maceo listened to the terms of the pact and responded with absolute clarity:

> **"We are not satisfied"**

He declared that neither he nor his troops would accept a peace that did not include **total independence** and the **complete abolition of slavery**. He informed Martínez Campos that hostilities would resume in **eight days**.

The Spanish general was stunned. He had underestimated Maceo — as many others would.

## Antonio Maceo: The Bronze Titan

To grasp the magnitude of Baraguá, you need to know the man behind the protest.

[Antonio Maceo Grajales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Maceo) was born on **June 14, 1845** in Santiago de Cuba, the son of Marcos Maceo, a Venezuelan mestizo, and [Mariana Grajales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Grajales), a free Black woman who would become known as the *Mother of the Nation*.

Maceo joined the war from its very first day in 1868. By 1878 he was:

- **Lieutenant General** of the Liberation Army
- A veteran of **over 500 battles**
- Bearer of **26 war wounds**
- A leader respected by white, Black, and mixed-race soldiers alike

He was called the **Bronze Titan** — not just for his skin color, but for his superhuman endurance in combat. On one occasion, gravely wounded, he reportedly cut a bullet from his own body with his knife to keep fighting.

## The Deeper Meaning

The Protest of Baraguá was far more than a military act. It was a **declaration of principles** with multiple dimensions:

### Racial Dignity
Maceo, a Black man in a slave-holding society, told the representative of an empire that ruled half the world that his terms were not good enough. In an era when [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Cubans#Slavery) was still legal in Cuba, this act defied not only colonial power but the entire racial structure of society.

### Revolutionary Resolve
Baraguá established a principle that would mark Cuban politics: **fundamental rights are not negotiable**. Either complete independence, or keep fighting.

### Unity in Diversity
The officers who accompanied Maceo were white, Black, and mixed-race. The protest demonstrated that the Cuban cause transcended the racial divisions Spain tried to exploit.

## After Baraguá

Maceo attempted to continue the fight, but military reality was unforgiving. Without resources, without external support, and with most of the army demobilized, he had to leave Cuba temporarily. He spent years in exile — Jamaica, Haiti, Honduras, Costa Rica — always planning the return.

The [Little War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_War_(Cuba)) of 1879-1880 was a failed attempt to reignite the struggle. But the seed of Baraguá grew into something greater.

When Martí organized the [Necessary War of 1895](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_War_of_Independence), Maceo was among the first to answer the call. His **Invasion from East to West** — a military march of over 1,000 kilometers across the entire island — remains one of the most impressive feats in [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) military history.

Maceo fell in combat on **December 7, 1896** at [San Pedro, Punta Brava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Pedro), near Havana. He was 51 years old and fighting on the front line, as always.

## A Legacy That Endures

The Protest of Baraguá transcended its historical moment. It became a **permanent symbol** of Cuban resistance:

- **March 15** is commemorated every year in Cuba
- The monument at Mangos de Baraguá is a place of pilgrimage
- Maceo's words — *"we are not satisfied"* — have been invoked in every moment of national crisis
- Martí wrote that Baraguá was where *"the full character of the revolution"* was revealed

As [Fernando Ortiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Ortiz), Cuba's great anthropologist, noted: Maceo didn't just protest against an unjust pact — **he protested against injustice itself**.

*Under the mango trees of eastern Cuba, a man of bronze said no to an empire. And Cuba was never the same.*
