faq:
  - question: "Why is Cuban enchilado called that if it doesn't contain chili?"
    answer: "The name is a false cognate. In the Caribbean, 'enchilado' refers to a red stew made with tomatoes, wine, and spices — not necessarily with hot chili peppers. It's a mild dish suitable for the whole family."
  - question: "What is the origin of enchilado de camarones?"
    answer: "It has Haitian origins. Enslaved people who fled during the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) brought the recipe to Cuba, where it evolved through contact with local Creole cooking traditions."
  - question: "Can enchilado be made with other seafood?"
    answer: "Yes. Enchilado is traditionally prepared with lobster, crab, crayfish, or fish. The technique and base sauce remain the same — only the protein changes."
  - question: "What is sour orange and why is it important in this recipe?"
    answer: "Sour orange (Citrus × aurantium) is a bitter citrus fruit essential to Cuban cuisine. In enchilado, it's used to marinate the shrimp and add acidity. You can substitute with a mix of orange juice and lime juice."

**Enchilado de camarones** is one of the most elegant and flavorful dishes in [Cuban cuisine](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-12-arroz-con-pollo-cubano/). Despite its name, it contains no chili — in the Caribbean, *enchilado* refers to a red stew of tomato, dry wine, and spices where seafood takes center stage.

## A Heritage That Crossed the Sea

The story of enchilado begins in **Haiti**. During the [Haitian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution) (1791-1804), thousands of enslaved people and French colonists fled to Cuba, bringing culinary traditions that would merge with the island's Creole cooking. Many settled in eastern Cuba — Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo — where enchilado put down deep roots.

Over time, the recipe absorbed ingredients and techniques from the Spanish, African, and Taíno cultures present in Cuba, becoming a mestizo dish that reflects the island's very identity.

## The Classic Recipe from Nitza Villapol

The best-known version appears in *Cocina al Minuto* by [Nitza Villapol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitza_Villapol), the grand dame of Cuban cooking. Her 1956 recipe remains the reference for generations of Cuban cooks.

### Ingredients (serves 4)

- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and cleaned
- Juice of 2 sour oranges (or a mix of orange and lime juice)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 can crushed tomatoes (14 oz)
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 bay leaf
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the shrimp** in sour orange juice with salt and pepper for 15-20 minutes. This marinade is the secret that sets Cuban enchilado apart.

2. **Prepare the sofrito**: Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sauté the onion and bell pepper until translucent (5-7 minutes). Add the crushed garlic and cook one more minute.

3. **The sauce**: Add the crushed tomatoes, dry wine, bay leaf, and cumin. Let it reduce over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes until you have a thick, fragrant sauce.

4. **The shrimp**: Drain the shrimp from the marinade and add them to the sauce. Cook for **exactly 3-4 minutes** — no more, no less. Shrimp overcook very quickly.

5. **Serve** over white rice, sprinkled with fresh parsley. Pair with [tostones](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-11-tostones-cubanos/) or [yuca con mojo](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-11-yuca-con-mojo/).

## The Secret Is in the Sour Orange

What separates a Cuban enchilado from any other shrimp stew in the world is **sour orange** (*Citrus × aurantium*). This bitter citrus fruit, a legacy of Spanish colonizers, is the soul of the [Cuban Creole marinade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange). Without it, enchilado loses its distinctive character.

In Miami and other cities with Cuban communities, sour orange is easily found at Latin markets. Outside the Caribbean, a mix of ¾ sweet orange juice with ¼ lime juice is the most accepted substitute.

## Enchilado Variations

Enchilado isn't exclusive to shrimp. Across Cuba, it's prepared with:

- **Lobster**: The most luxurious version, especially popular along the coasts of Pinar del Río and Isla de la Juventud.
- **Crab**: Common in Cienfuegos and Trinidad.
- **Fish**: A more economical but equally delicious option.

Each region has its own touch. In eastern Cuba, enchilado tends to be spicier; in Havana, milder with more wine.

## A Dish for Special Occasions

In today's Cuba, shrimp are a luxury. Enchilado is reserved for birthdays, New Year's celebrations, and important visits. It's a dish that says "I want to honor you" — a gesture of hospitality that transcends the culinary.

Served with fluffy white rice, a cold [mojito](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-10-mojito-cubano-historia-receta-perfecta/), and good company, enchilado de camarones is Cuba at its finest: mestizo, generous, and bursting with flavor.
