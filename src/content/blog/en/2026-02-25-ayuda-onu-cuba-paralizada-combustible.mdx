The ambitious humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations in Cuba, valued at millions of dollars, are currently at a dead end. The main reason is the severe fuel shortage paralyzing internal transport on the island, a situation aggravated by the intensification of the international energy blockade.

## Assistance Slowed Down After Hurricane Melissa

Following the passage of the devastating Hurricane Melissa, the UN mobilized significant resources to support the most vulnerable communities. However, high-ranking officials of the organization in Havana have warned that these supplies run the risk of spoiling or not reaching those who need them most in time.

At the Port of El Mariel, tons of food products and medical supplies remain stored as trucks cannot distribute them due to the critical lack of diesel. This logistical paralysis directly impacts child nutrition programs and support for the elderly, sectors that crucially depend on this external aid.

## Impact on Daily Life

The energy crisis is not only stalling international aid; it has transformed the daily life of Cubans into a struggle for survival:

*   **Prolonged Blackouts:** The national electricity deficit exceeds 1,700 MW daily.
*   **Paralyzed Transport:** The state transport system has nearly disappeared from the capital's streets.
*   **Minimum Services:** Public hospitals are operating under critical conditions, postponing non-essential surgeries.
*   **Industry at a Halt:** Much of the local production has stopped to prioritize the scarce electricity flow to residential areas.

## FAQ

### Why can't UN aid be distributed in Cuba?
Due to the critical lack of fuel (mainly diesel), the trucks responsible for logistics cannot move supplies from ports to inland provinces.

### What type of aid is at risk of being lost?
It consists mostly of dry foods, powdered milk, and medical supplies intended for areas affected by Hurricane Melissa and the most vulnerable sectors of the population.

### What is the UN's stance on this situation?
United Nations officials have expressed deep concern, noting that the energy blockade is creating a "humanitarian catastrophe" by preventing assistance from reaching its destination.

### How does this affect Cuban public health?
The lack of distributed supplies, combined with blackouts affecting the cold chain, puts the treatment of chronic diseases and emergency care at risk.
