# Cuban Rum: The Spirit of an Island

Some drinks transcend the simple act of drinking. **Cuban rum** is one of them: a spirit that tells stories of sugarcane plantations, colonial ports, and Havana nights where son music mixes with the clinking of glasses.

Cuba didn't invent rum, but it perfected it. And that perfection has a name: **Cuban light rum**, a style that revolutionized the world industry and remains the benchmark for distillers across the globe.

## History of Rum in Cuba

### Colonial Origins

The history of Cuban rum begins in the 16th century when Spanish colonizers brought sugarcane to the Caribbean. Molasses, a byproduct of sugar mills, was fermented to produce a rustic aguardiente consumed by slaves and sailors.

By the 18th century, Cuba was already exporting "sugarcane aguardiente" to Spain and other colonies. But the real qualitative leap came in the 19th century.

### The Light Rum Revolution

In 1862, a Spanish immigrant named **Facundo Bacardí Massó** experimented with filtering and aging techniques in Santiago de Cuba. The result was a smoother, cleaner, more elegant rum: the birth of **Cuban light rum**.

This innovation changed everything. While other Caribbean rums were heavy and harsh, Cuban rum seduced with its refinement. By 1900, Cuba was synonymous with world-class rum.

### The 20th Century and the Revolution

The 1959 revolution transformed the industry. Distilleries were nationalized and Bacardí went into exile (today producing in Puerto Rico and Mexico). The Cuban government created **Cuba Ron S.A.**, which groups the main national brands.

The Havana Club brand, which had belonged to the Arechabala family, was relaunched in 1972 and today is the international face of Cuban rum, distributed globally by Pernod Ricard.

## Cuban Rum and Culture

Rum isn't just a drink in Cuba; it's a character in national culture. It appears in Benny Moré's songs, in Guillermo Cabrera Infante's novels, in paintings depicting Havana life.

Ernest Hemingway immortalized the daiquirí at El Floridita and the mojito at La Bodeguita del Medio. Fidel Castro gifted Havana Club to foreign dignitaries. Cuban rum is diplomacy, it's music, it's liquid history.
