The Canadian government announced on Thursday an **emergency humanitarian aid package worth 8 million Canadian dollars** destined for Cuba, responding to intense diplomatic efforts by Cuban ambassador Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, who presented the energy and food crisis gripping the island.

The decision comes as **migration pressure toward the United States intensifies**, with thousands of Cubans considering leaving the island due to constant blackouts, fuel shortages, and lack of basic food supplies.

## Humanitarian Crisis Drives New Migration Wave

According to testimony presented by Malmierca to Canadian parliamentarians, **Cuba has not received oil shipments from Venezuela since the end of last year** due to U.S. pressure, creating a critical shortage that has paralyzed essential sectors of the economy and daily life.

This unprecedented energy crisis has created conditions that **intensify migration pressure**, especially toward the United States, where Cuban deportations have reached record levels under the Trump administration.

Canadian aid will be distributed through UN agencies, including the World Food Program and UNICEF, to support the most vulnerable groups facing severe shortages of basic goods.

## Current Migration Context

Cuba's humanitarian crisis coincides with a hardening of U.S. immigration policies:

- **Record deportations**: Trump has deported more Cubans than any previous president
- **Elimination of protections**: ICE has eliminated historic protections for Cuban migrants
- **Labor restrictions**: New limitations on work permits for asylum seekers

### Impact on Migration Decisions

Constant blackouts and lack of basic services are **accelerating emigration decisions** among Cubans who see few options for short-term improvement on the island.

"The situation has become unsustainable," explain consulted sources, who describe hospitals without electricity, paralyzed public transportation, and critical food shortages.

## Divided International Response

While Canada responds with humanitarian aid, the United States maintains its **"maximum pressure" policy** on Cuba, including:

- Reinforced economic embargo
- Restrictions on oil shipments
- Accelerated deportations of Cuban migrants

This divergence in approaches reflects different perspectives on how to address the Cuban crisis, with Canada prioritizing humanitarian relief while the U.S. maintains political pressure.

## FAQ: Humanitarian Crisis and Migration

### How does Cuba's energy crisis affect migration?
The lack of electricity, fuel, and basic food is pushing more Cubans to consider emigration as their only viable alternative, especially toward the United States.

### What does Canada's humanitarian aid include?
The 8 million Canadian dollars will go primarily to food aid distributed through UN organizations like the World Food Program and UNICEF.

### Why did Canada decide to send aid now?
The decision followed diplomatic efforts by Cuban ambassador Rodrigo Malmierca, who presented evidence of the severity of the humanitarian crisis during meetings with Canadian parliamentarians.

### How does the United States respond to this crisis?
Unlike Canada, the U.S. maintains its economic pressure policy on Cuba while simultaneously deporting Cuban migrants in record numbers, creating a complex migration paradox.

Canadian aid represents international recognition of the **severity of the humanitarian crisis** in Cuba, while the hardening of U.S. immigration policies creates a contradictory scenario where the crisis is acknowledged but migration escape routes are restricted for those suffering from it.

This situation underscores the complexity of policies toward Cuba and their implications for regional migration flows, especially when humanitarian crises intersect with long-term political considerations.
