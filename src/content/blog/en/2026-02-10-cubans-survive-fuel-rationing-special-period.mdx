In a neighborhood in southwest Havana, 68-year-old Elizabeth Contreras stirs charcoal in a makeshift kitchen built on cement blocks. On the grill is chicken that will feed **three neighborhood families**.

"Many people have been cooking like this for days because electric pots can barely be used without power and there's little gas left," she tells [BBC Mundo](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cyv9prv250vo). "We help each other as neighbors in this uncertainty."

## Echoes of the Special Period

The current situation brings back memories of the 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into a crisis known as the **Special Period**.

Contreras, who lived through that era, says "what's happening now seems worse to me." In recent weeks, she has experienced **power outages lasting up to 18 hours** on more than one occasion.

President Díaz-Canel revived the concept of **"option zero"** — a survival plan proposed in the 90s for a scenario without oil.

## Worse Than Before?

Michael Bustamante, a professor at the University of Miami, provides context: between 1991 and 1994, Cuba's GDP fell by more than a third. Since the pandemic, the decline is estimated at 11%.

"The Cuban economy never fully recovered after the Special Period," he explains. "Although the current collapse is smaller in percentage terms, **it feels worse because it starts from an already delicate situation**."

The academic also points to a key difference: inequality. "After the emergence of well-stocked private stores, those with money can get things. There's **rampant inequality** that has little to do with what was experienced in the 90s."

## Daily Life

Jennifer Pedraza, 34, stockpiles supplies to survive: light bulbs, rechargeable fans and lamps, portable chargers. "I also store water, which is failing."

Her main concern is her 9-year-old son: "There's almost never power at school. He has to do homework in the dark. He can't watch cartoons or use his phone. **It's hard for a child to be in the dark all the time**."

## The Numbers Behind the Crisis

With an **average salary of 6,830 Cuban pesos** (about $14 USD on the informal market):

- A bottle of cooking oil: ~$2.50 USD
- 30 eggs: ~$6 USD

More than half of monthly income goes to basics.

Those with relatives abroad sending remittances cope better. The rest make do as best they can.
