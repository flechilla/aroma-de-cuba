# Cuba on the Brink: Energy Deficit Hits 65%, Eastern Provinces Left in Total Darkness

The energy situation in Cuba has reached unprecedented levels in early March 2026. A generation deficit exceeding 65% of national demand has left most of the island in almost total darkness, with eastern provinces reporting blackouts of more than 20 hours daily.

## A Staged Collapse
What began as maintenance crises at thermoelectric plants has turned into a systemic paralysis due to a critical lack of fuel. According to recent reports, provinces such as Guantánamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, and Granma have experienced periods of "zero generation," where only vital centers like hospitals maintain service.

In Havana, scheduled cuts have gone from 4 to 12 or even 18 hours per day, affecting food preservation and the water supply, which is closely dependent on electric pumping.

## Impact on Daily Life
The lack of power is not the only problem. Garbage accumulation in the streets and the paralysis of public transport have created a scenario of total stagnation. Cubans are desperately seeking alternatives, such as improvised solar charging stations in parks, to keep their phones operational—their only link to the outside world.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why are there so many blackouts in Cuba now?
The crisis is due to a combination of a lack of foreign currency to buy fuel, the obsolescence of thermoelectric plants and decreasing subsidized supplies.

### Which areas are most affected?
Eastern Cuba (Guantánamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín) suffers the longest cuts, often exceeding 20 hours daily.

### How does this affect the water supply?
Most pumping systems require electricity. Without power, water does not reach elevated tanks or distribution networks, worsening the health crisis.

### Is there a short-term solution?
Authorities have mentioned the arrival of fuel shipments in mid-March, but experts warn that without deep investment, blackouts will continue to be the norm.
