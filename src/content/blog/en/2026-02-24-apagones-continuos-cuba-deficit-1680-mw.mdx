faq:
  - question: "What is the main cause of the current blackouts in Cuba?"
    answer: "The crisis is multi-faceted: a lack of foreign currency to import fuel, aging thermoelectric infrastructure over 40 years old, and tightened sanctions on oil shipments."
  - question: "Which provinces are most affected?"
    answer: "While all of Cuba suffers from the deficit, central and eastern provinces traditionally face longer cuts, sometimes up to 18 hours a day in rural areas."
  - question: "Is there a short-term solution for the electricity crisis?"
    answer: "Authorities are betting on a transition to solar energy and partial repairs, but experts argue the system requires a capital investment of billions of dollars that the country currently lacks."
  - question: "How does a 1680 MW deficit affect the country?"
    answer: "A deficit of this magnitude means that more than half of the national peak demand cannot be met, forcing massive, rotating circuit disconnections across the island."

Cuba's energy crisis reached a new critical point this Monday, with the Electric Union (UNE) reporting uninterrupted service cuts over 24 hours and a generation deficit that hit **1680 MW**. The situation remains extremely tense following a Sunday where the country also found no respite from the blackouts.

According to the UNE's official report, the maximum impact during peak hours tonight is estimated at alarming levels, affecting nearly the entire national territory simultaneously. The main causes continue to be a severe lack of fuel and breakdowns in key units of the thermoelectric power plants (CTE).

## A System on the Brink of Collapse

The technical report details that multiple units are out of service due to breakdowns at the Santa Cruz, Felton, and Rente power plants. Additionally, several units in Mariel, Cienfuegos, and Rente are undergoing maintenance. This combination of scheduled maintenance and unexpected failures has left the national system with minimal response capacity.

Compounding the problem is the critical shortage of fuel (diesel and fuel oil), which prevents distributed generation plants and floating power ships (powerships) from operating at full capacity.

## Impact on Daily Life

Blackouts lasting more than 12 hours a day are no longer the exception but the rule in most provinces. The impact extends to basic services such as water supply, food preservation, and healthcare. In Havana, although initially better protected, cuts are now being felt strongly across all municipalities, including unscheduled interruptions due to substation failures.
