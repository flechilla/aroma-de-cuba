The Trump administration dealt a devastating blow to Cuban legal migration by revoking the CHNV humanitarian program (Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans), leaving **more than half a million migrants in legal limbo** and facing potential deportations.

## What was the CHNV Program?

The **CHNV humanitarian parole program** was created during the Biden administration to offer a legal and safe migration pathway for citizens of these four countries. For Cubans, it represented a crucial alternative to dangerous sea voyages or irregular land routes.

### Benefits now lost:
- **Legal work authorization** for two years
- **Temporary protection from deportation**
- **Ability to apply for other statuses** like asylum or TPS
- **Family reunification** with sponsors in the US

## The devastating announcement

On March 25, 2026, the Department of Homeland Security published in the Federal Register the **immediate revocation** of the program. Beneficiaries began receiving individual letters notifying them that their permission to remain and work legally in the United States had been **prematurely rescinded**.

> "As of April 24, all remaining grants of parole under CHNV will become invalid," DHS confirmed in its official statement.

## The alarming numbers

According to analysis by the Office of Homeland Security Statistics (through November 2024), approximately **195,000 people** with current parole grants under CHNV did not qualify to apply for:
- Temporary Protected Status (TPS)
- Adjustment to permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act

This means that **nearly 200,000 people** —many of them Cubans— will be left without legal protection against deportation in the coming weeks.

## The political context

Trump's hostility toward parole programs created by Biden has been evident since day one of his administration. The CHNV program received particular criticism after the Biden administration temporarily paused applications last summer to investigate fraud allegations.

### Other simultaneous blows:
- **CBP One cancellation** on Trump's first day
- **Threats to Venezuelan TPS** (partially blocked by courts)
- **Mass deportations** to countries of origin

## Ongoing legal battles

The case **Svitlana Doe v. Noem**, filed in Massachusetts federal court, challenges the Trump administration's widespread parole revocations, including CHNV. Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing the government from canceling parole for CHNV recipients.

**Oral arguments** are scheduled for this week, in a race against time before the April 24 deadline.

## The information crisis

One of the most concerning aspects is that **many beneficiaries don't know** that their two-year protection is no longer two years. Factors complicating the situation:

- **Address changes** not reported to the federal government
- **Language barriers** to understanding official letters
- **Lack of awareness** about pending legal cases
- **Lack of resources** to hire legal assistance

## Impact on the Cuban community

For Cubans, CHNV elimination represents more than losing a program: it's the **systematic dismantling** of legal migration pathways that have historically characterized Cuba-US migration relations.

### Limited options remaining:
1. **Apply for asylum** (long and complex process)
2. **Apply for Cuban Adjustment Act** (if they qualify)
3. **Seek other forms of migration relief**
4. **Face deportation** to Cuba

## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about CHNV

### What happens if I have CHNV and haven't applied for another status?
Your parole will expire on April 24, 2026. It's crucial to immediately consult with an immigration attorney to explore options like asylum or the Cuban Adjustment Act.

### Can I renew my CHNV?
No. The program has been completely eliminated and no renewals are available.

### What happens to my work permit?
Your employment authorization will also be revoked on April 24. You cannot work legally without another valid immigration status.

### Is there any legal hope?
Yes. The Svitlana Doe v. Noem case could result in a court order temporarily extending protections while the case is litigated.

## The uncertain future

The elimination of the CHNV program marks a **historic turning point** in US migration policy toward Cuba. What was once promoted as a system that promoted "more predictability in arrivals and departures" has become a devastating example of **massive migration uncertainty**.

For half a million people who bet on the legal route, the message is clear: even authorized humanitarian programs can disappear overnight under new administrations.

**The countdown has begun. For thousands of Cuban families, every day counts.**
