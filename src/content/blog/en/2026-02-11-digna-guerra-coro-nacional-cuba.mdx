At the musical heart of Cuba beats a unique institution: the **Cuban National Choir** (*Coro Nacional de Cuba*), and at its helm for over half a century, an extraordinary woman: maestra **Digna Guerra Ramírez**. This is the story of how a choir born from revolution became an ambassador of Cuban culture to the world.

## From the Mountains to the Stage: A Revolutionary Origin

Few know the singular origin of Cuba's National Choir. In 1959, in the midst of revolutionary fervor, commanders [Ernesto "Che" Guevara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara) and [Camilo Cienfuegos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Cienfuegos) had an unconventional idea: create a choir within the Rebel Army. Thus was born the **Rebel Army Choir** (*Coro del Ejército Rebelde*), directed by maestro [Serafín Pro Guardiola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coro_Nacional_de_Cuba).

A year later, in 1960, this group transformed into the National Theater Choir, and eventually received its definitive name: **Coro Nacional de Cuba**. Since then, it has been the guardian of Cuban and universal choral tradition.

## Digna Guerra: The Maestra of Voices

In 1975, a young 30-year-old conductor took up the baton of the National Choir. **Digna Guerra**, born in Havana on August 6, 1945, couldn't have imagined that half a century later she would still be leading this institution.

Her training is impeccable: she studied at the [Havana Conservatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeo_Rold%C3%A1n_Conservatory), specialized in choral direction with Gisela Hernández, and perfected her studies at the prestigious **Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler** in Germany, where she received honors in Choral Direction, Piano, and Voice.

Under her direction, the National Choir has achieved international recognition, including the prestigious **Echo Klassik** from Germany in 2012, one of the most important awards in European classical music.

## A Repertoire Spanning Centuries and Borders

Cuba's National Choir performs a repertoire ranging from 15th-century polyphony to the most complex contemporary works. But its true mission has been the dissemination of **Cuban choral music** across all eras and styles.

Among its most notable collaborations:

- World premiere of [Michel Legrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Legrand)'s "Concert Oratorio"
- [Mikis Theodorakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikis_Theodorakis)'s "Canto General" in Havana and Managua
- [José María Vitier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Vitier)'s "Psalm of the Americas"
- "Carmina Burana" under the direction of [Leo Brouwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer)

## Entrevoces: The Chamber Jewel

In 1981, Digna Guerra founded the **Entrevoces Chamber Choir**, a more intimate group that has become a benchmark for Latin American choral music. This choir was selected to represent the continent at the World Symposium on Choral Music in Minneapolis (2002) and Kyoto (2005).

The Entrevoces Choir has swept international competitions, winning first prizes in both habaneras and polyphony at the International Habaneras Competition in Torrevieja, Spain.

## More Than Music: A Cultural Mission

Digna Guerra's work transcends choral direction. She is a tenured professor at the [Instituto Superior de Arte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Superior_de_Arte), presides over the Cuban Choir Association, directs the América Cantat International Festival, and serves as vice president of the Caribbean Choral Federation.

She has given master classes in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, and Germany. Her **Cantorías** project trains hundreds of Cuban children in choral art, ensuring the continuity of this tradition.

Among her recognitions: **National Music Prize**, **Félix Varela Order**, and the title of **Hero of Labor of the Republic of Cuba**.

## The Legacy Continues

Today, at 80 years old, Digna Guerra remains at the helm of Cuba's National Choir, preparing new generations and carrying Cuban voices around the world. The choir that was born in the mountains with the rebels now resonates in the world's finest theaters.

As she herself has said: *"Singing is the purest expression of a people's soul."* And Cuba's National Choir, under her tireless baton, continues to be the voice of Cuba.
