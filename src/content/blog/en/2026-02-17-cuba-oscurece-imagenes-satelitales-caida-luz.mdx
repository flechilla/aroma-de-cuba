    answer: "According to a Bloomberg analysis based on NASA data, nighttime light intensity in several Cuban cities has dropped by up to 50% compared to historical levels."
  - question: "Which Cuban cities are most affected by blackouts?"
    answer: "Santiago de Cuba and Holguín in the eastern part of the country have experienced the largest drops in nighttime illumination. Havana remains relatively lit due to its political priority."

## Cuba from space: an island going dark

A striking analysis published by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2026-cuba-electricidad/) reveals what millions of Cubans experience every night: the island is literally going dark. Satellite images based on NASA data show that nighttime light intensity in several Cuban cities has **dropped by up to 50%** compared to historical levels.

The visual evidence is overwhelming. Eastern cities like **Santiago de Cuba and Holguín** appear considerably dimmer or completely dark in nighttime captures. The contrast with images from previous months is dramatic.

## Havana: the relative exception

While eastern Cuba plunges into darkness, central Havana remains mostly illuminated. According to experts cited by Bloomberg, this is explained by both the **political priority** given to the seat of government and a greater capacity to adopt alternative solutions such as solar panels and battery systems.

However, even the capital is deteriorating. Eastern Havana neighborhoods like **Alamar and Cojímar** already show lower light intensity. President Díaz-Canel himself [acknowledged increased blackouts in Havana](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-05-u1-e135253-s27061-nid320163-diaz-canel-reconoce-aumento-apagones-habana) due to the decision to prioritize electricity for the economy.

## The perfect energy storm

Cuba's electrical system was already struggling with vulnerabilities when a serious breakdown in December disrupted the connection between Havana and key thermoelectric plants in Matanzas. Then the situation collapsed:

- **January 3**: The capture of Nicolás Maduro cut Venezuelan oil supply
- **January 9**: Mexico made its last significant crude delivery
- **February**: Washington's warning about tariffs on countries supplying fuel to Cuba closed the last routes

The Trump administration blocked shipments that accounted for **nearly 60%** of the approximately 100,000 daily barrels Cuba needs to sustain electricity generation. Since then, the island has not received significant oil deliveries.

## Emergency measures

Facing collapse, the government has implemented drastic measures:

- Reduced public transportation routes
- **Four-day state work week**
- Closure of tourist facilities
- Gasoline sales restrictions
- [72-hour power cuts for businesses violating energy savings rules](/en/blog/cuba-cortes-luz-empresas-ahorro-energia/)

Analysts estimate that available reserves could cover **fewer than 20 days of consumption**, though no official figures exist.

## Worse than the Special Period

Specialists warn that, unlike the 1990s crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, today's electrical system is significantly more deteriorated. Aging thermoelectric plants and the complete lack of new infrastructure investment make recovery more difficult even if fuel supplies were restored.

The satellite images don't lie: Cuba is going dark, and every night without power deepens a crisis affecting millions of people in their daily lives.
