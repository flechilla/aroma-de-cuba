A Cuban migrant holding an I-220A form shared his experience on social media after appearing before the Immigration Court in Orlando, Florida this Thursday. His account offers valuable insight into the current process and concerns faced by thousands of Cubans in similar situations.

## "My Biggest Fear Was Being Detained"

"I just left the Orlando Court. I'm making this video to share information. There are many videos before going to court, but it's always good to have the latest updates," the young man explained in his recorded testimony.

The migrant, who attended with legal representation, revealed that both he and another Cuban present received new court dates for **late 2026**. This delay reflects the current state of the immigration system, with hearings scheduled years in advance due to accumulated backlog.

**His main fear** was being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when attending the court appointment. However, he described the environment as "very calm" with no visible ICE operations inside the courthouse building.

"There was nobody making ICE detentions; there was nothing unusual. That was my biggest worry, that they would literally detain me, but everything else was perfectly fine," he assured.

## The I-220A Form: A Legal Lifeline

The I-220A form serves as a document of **parole or supervision** granted to certain migrants upon entry into the United States. In recent years, thousands of Cubans have received this status, remaining pending judicial proceedings that will determine their legal stay in the country.

### I-220A Characteristics:
- **Allows remaining free** while immigration case is resolved
- **Requires periodic appearances** before immigration courts
- **Does not guarantee permanent residence**, but prevents immediate detention
- **Subject to specific conditions** like maintaining updated address

## System Delays: Why Wait Until 2026?

The **overload of the federal immigration system** has resulted in hearings scheduled years in advance. This phenomenon leaves many applicants in **prolonged legal uncertainty**.

Contributing factors to delays:
- **Massive volume** of pending cases
- **Limited judicial staff** to process hearings
- **Case complexity** requiring thorough review
- **Immigration policy changes** affecting processing priorities

This young Cuban's testimony joins a **growing number of migrant stories** aimed at sharing practical information about court appearances, especially amid heightened federal immigration oversight.

## What's Next for Cubans with I-220A?

For now, this young man must wait until late 2026 for his next appearance before an immigration judge, while **remaining free under the conditions** stipulated in his I-220A form.

His case illustrates the reality of thousands of Cubans navigating the complex U.S. legal system, balancing hope and anxiety while awaiting decisions that will determine their future in the country.
