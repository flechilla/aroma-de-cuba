The United States Coast Guard has redirected a significant portion of its operational resources to support the mass deportation of detained immigrants, a move that is generating strong internal tensions within the institution.

## Over 750 Flights Diverted from Rescue Missions

According to a report by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/noems-use-coast-guard-resources-strains-relationship-military-branch-s-rcna258904), data collected by the organization ICE Flight Monitor reveals that **more than 750 Coast Guard flights have been diverted** from their regular functions — maritime patrols, surveillance, and search and rescue — to transporting detained migrants to deportation centers.

The increase in these flights occurred rapidly during 2025, with a **notable jump between June and November**. Some airports, such as the one in Sacramento, have reportedly received guidance that places the internal transportation of detained immigrants among their top operational priorities.

## A Decision Tied to Trump's Strategy

This resource reallocation is directly linked to President Donald Trump's immigration strategy, which has set ambitious goals for expulsions. Secretary of Homeland Security [Kristi Noem](https://www.dhs.gov/secretary) oversees the implementation of these measures within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes the Coast Guard.

The Trump administration has intensified deportations of Cubans to unprecedented levels. As we previously reported, [over 170 Cubans were deported on the first flight of 2026](/blog/en/2026-02-11-170-cubanos-deportados-eeuu-primer-vuelo) and [45,000 Cubans face active deportation orders](/blog/en/2026-02-11-cubanos-deportacion-eeuu-crisis).

## Internal Tensions and Safety Concerns

Sources cited in the report indicate that the reallocation has created **discomfort among officials**, particularly because search and rescue has historically been regarded as the institution's core mission.

> Some officials have expressed concern about the impact this change could have on the culture and internal morale of the organization.

The DHS denied that there is a formal directive prioritizing deportations over emergency missions. A spokesperson stated that the Coast Guard "remains prepared to respond to rescue operations and balances its various responsibilities without neglecting maritime safety."

## What Does This Mean for Cubans?

For Cuban migrants, this news has a troubling dual impact:

1. **Fewer rescue resources:** With aircraft dedicated to deportations, search and rescue operations in the Florida Straits and Caribbean are potentially reduced, putting those [attempting to reach the US by sea](/blog/en/2026-02-10-nicaragua-cierra-ruta-migratoria-cubanos) at greater risk.

2. **Accelerated deportations:** Military infrastructure is being adapted to facilitate larger-scale expulsions, directly affecting the [500,000 Cubans with I-220A documents](/blog/en/2026-02-17-i220a-demanda-colectiva-500mil-cubanos) living in legal limbo.

3. **Crisis context:** All of this is happening while Cuba faces [an unprecedented humanitarian crisis](/blog/en/2026-02-18-crisis-humanitaria-cuba-mortalidad-emigracion), with 2 million emigrants since 2021.

## A Growing Debate

The tension described by NBC News comes at a time of heightened public scrutiny of US immigration policy, sparking debates both domestically and internationally regarding the scope and methods used to achieve deportation goals.

Meanwhile, lawyers in Miami continue fighting in courts to have I-220A documents recognized as equivalent to parole, a legal battle that could [redefine the future of hundreds of thousands of Cubans](/blog/en/2026-02-11-formularios-i220-cubanos-guia).
