# Cuban Beers: A Refreshing Caribbean Tradition

In Cuba's tropical heat, few things satisfy like a **cold beer**. Cuban beers have a fascinating history spanning over 130 years, evolving from small colonial breweries to the iconic brands enjoyed on the island and worldwide today.

## The Origins: La Tropical and the Birth of an Industry

Cuba's beer history formally begins in **1888** with the founding of **La Tropical** in Puentes Grandes, Havana. This pioneering brewery marked the start of Cuba's brewing industry, though its early products were far from today's quality.

With help from German and French master brewers, La Tropical perfected its recipes over time. The Gardens of La Tropical became a legendary Havana social hub where families enjoyed music, dancing, and of course, cold beer.

## The Great Rivalries: Hatuey vs Polar

Before 1959, Cuba's beer market was vibrant and competitive. Two brands dominated popular preference:

- **Hatuey**: Named after the Taíno chief, it was Cuba's premium beer
- **Polar**: Its direct rival, equally beloved by Cubans

These brands sponsored baseball teams, radio programs, and cultural events. Their advertising campaigns are now pieces of Cuban graphic history.

## The Modern Era: Cristal, Cuba's Favorite

**Cerveza Cristal** was born in the 1920s and remains Cuba's most popular beer. Its historic slogan, *"Clara, ligera y sabrosa"* (Clear, light, and tasty), perfectly describes its character:

**Cristal Characteristics:**
- **Style**: American light lager
- **Alcohol**: 4.9%
- **Color**: Pale gold, crystal clear
- **Flavor**: Light, refreshing, mild bitterness
- **Pairing**: Perfect with [roast pork](/en/blog/2026-02-10-lechon-asado-cubano/), [moros y cristianos](/en/blog/2026-02-11-moros-y-cristianos/), and any Cuban food

Cristal is produced by [Cervecería Bucanero S.A.](https://www.cerveceriabucanero.com/), a joint venture established in 1997 between Cuba and international brewing giant [AB InBev](https://www.ab-inbev.com/).

## Bucanero: Strength and Character

For those who prefer a beer with more body, **Bucanero** is the choice. Launched in 1997, it quickly gained a following:

**Bucanero Characteristics:**
- **Style**: Strong lager
- **Alcohol**: 5.4%
- **Color**: Dark amber
- **Flavor**: Malty, fuller body, pronounced bitterness
- **Ideal for**: Long nights, robust pairings, barbecues

Its distinctive bottle with the pirate on the label is recognizable in any Cuban bar.

## Other Cuban Beers

The Cuban market also offers:

| Brand | Style | Alcohol | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Mayabe** | Light lager | 4.5% | Economic, refreshing |
| **Cacique** | Light lager | 4.8% | Regional, produced in eastern Cuba |
| **Tinima** | Lager | 4.5% | Produced in Camagüey |

## Craft Beer in Cuba

In recent years, a **craft beer** movement has emerged in Cuba. Small producers experiment with IPA, stout, and wheat beer styles, though distribution remains limited to certain Havana bars.

Places like [Fábrica de Arte Cubano](https://www.ffrr.org/) and some Vedado paladares offer craft options for the adventurous.

## How to Enjoy Cuban Beer

Cubans have their rituals:

1. **Ice cold**: In the tropics, beer must be almost frozen
2. **Bottle or can**: Glass preserves flavor better
3. **With ice** (optional): Some add a cube to keep it cold
4. **Accompanied**: With [tostones](/en/blog/2026-02-11-tostones-cubanos/), peanuts, or chicharrones

## Where to Find Cuban Beers

**In Cuba:**
- Any bodega, bar, or restaurant
- Currency markets (CUP/MLC)
- Hotels and resorts

**Abroad:**
- Specialty Latin stores
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) (availability varies by country)

## Beer in Cuban Culture

Beer is integral to Cuban social life. Toasts are made at birthdays, weddings, Sunday baseball games, and any family gathering. The sound of a bottle opening is the prelude to conversation, music, and the joy that characterizes Cuba.
