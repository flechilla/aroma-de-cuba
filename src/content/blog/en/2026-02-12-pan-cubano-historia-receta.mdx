faq:
  - question: "What makes Cuban bread different from other breads?"
    answer: "Cuban bread stands out for its thin, crispy crust, soft and light crumb, and the characteristic split on top created by a palmetto leaf during baking. It uses lard instead of olive oil or butter."
  - question: "Can you make Cuban bread without a palmetto leaf?"
    answer: "Yes, you can substitute the palmetto leaf with a slash from a sharp blade just before baking. The result is similar, though the split won't be as pronounced or uniform as the one left by the natural leaf."
  - question: "Why is La Segunda Bakery so famous?"
    answer: "La Segunda Central Bakery was founded in 1915 by Juan Moré in Ybor City, Tampa. It's the oldest Cuban bakery in the United States and produces over 18,000 loaves daily using the original palmetto leaf technique."
  - question: "Does Cuban bread contain eggs or milk?"
    answer: "No. Traditional Cuban bread only uses flour, water, salt, sugar, yeast, and lard. It's a simple dough with no eggs or dairy, making it naturally egg-free and suitable for many diets."

# Cuban Bread: History, Recipe, and the Palmetto Leaf Secret

There are breads that nourish and breads that tell stories. **Cuban bread** does both. With its golden crust that shatters when you break it and a crumb so soft it feels like cotton, this humble bread has been the inseparable companion of [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuban-coffee-cafecito-history-recipe/), the star of the [Cuban sandwich](/en/blog/2026-02-11-sandwich-cubano/), and the silent witness to over a century of Cuban-American history.

But what truly makes it unique isn't just its flavor — it's a **palmetto leaf** placed on the dough before baking, a detail that seems minor but defines its entire identity.

## From Colonial Ovens to Ybor City's Cigar Workers

The history of Cuban bread begins in the colonial bakeries of Havana, where bakers crafted a long, crusty loaf influenced by Spanish and French traditions. But it was in **Tampa, Florida**, where this bread found its true fame.

In the late 19th century, [Ybor City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ybor_City) was a multicultural melting pot of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian cigar workers. The tobacco factories needed to feed thousands of workers, and Cuban bread became the daily sustenance of the entire community.

### Juan Moré and La Segunda Central Bakery

In 1915, a Spanish soldier named **Juan Moré** — born in Catalonia and smitten with Cuban bread during the Spanish-American War — co-founded three cooperative bakeries with fellow bakers and cigar makers: La Primera, La Segunda, and La Tercera. When the other two folded, Moré purchased [La Segunda Central Bakery](https://www.lasegundabakery.com/our-story), which still stands today as **the oldest Cuban bakery in the United States**.

Four generations later, La Segunda produces over **18,000 loaves daily** and ships Cuban bread to restaurants and markets across the country. And yes, they still use palmetto leaves.

## The Palmetto Leaf Secret

What separates real Cuban bread from any baguette or Italian loaf is a technique as simple as it is ingenious: before the dough goes into the oven, bakers place a **palmetto leaf** lengthwise along each loaf.

What does the leaf do? Three things:

1. **Retains moisture** during baking, creating that thin, crispy crust (not thick like a baguette)
2. **Creates the characteristic split** — that line running from end to end
3. **Allows the dough to expand** uniformly, producing an airy, light crumb

As the oven's heat dries the leaf, it separates naturally, leaving its signature on every loaf. It's poetic baking.

However, this tradition is [at risk](https://www.tampabay.com/life-culture/history/2022/06/23/tampa-tradition-of-baking-cuban-bread-with-palm-leaves-at-risk/). Modern health regulations and the difficulty of sourcing fresh leaves threaten a practice that has defined Tampa's Cuban bread for over a century.

## Ingredients: The Beauty of Simplicity

Cuban bread is a bread of **humble ingredients** — and therein lies its greatness:

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Bread flour | 500 g (4 cups) | Structure and gluten |
| Warm water | 300 ml (1¼ cups) | Hydration |
| Lard | 30 g (2 tbsp) | Softness and flavor |
| Sugar | 15 g (1 tbsp) | Food for yeast |
| Salt | 10 g (2 tsp) | Flavor |
| Active dry yeast | 7 g (1 packet) | Fermentation |

Notice what's **not there**: no eggs, no milk, no olive oil, no butter. **Lard** is the ingredient that separates Cuban bread from French or Italian bread, giving it that characteristic soft texture.

## Traditional Recipe Step by Step

### 1. Prepare the Dough
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let rest 5 minutes until bubbly. In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the lard and yeast water. Knead 10-12 minutes until you get an elastic, smooth dough.

### 2. First Rise
Cover with a damp cloth and let rest **1 hour** in a warm place until doubled in size.

### 3. Shape the Loaves
Gently deflate the dough. Divide into 2-3 portions and shape into long loaves about **14-16 inches** long. The shape is oval, wider in the center and tapered at the ends.

### 4. The Palmetto Leaf (or Alternative)
If you can get fresh palm leaves, place one lengthwise along each loaf. If not, make a **half-inch deep lengthwise slash** with a sharp blade.

### 5. Second Rise
Let the loaves rest on a greased baking sheet for **30-40 more minutes**, covered with a cloth.

### 6. Bake
- Preheat oven to **200°C (400°F)**
- Place a pan of water on the bottom rack (steam = crispy crust)
- Bake **25-30 minutes** until golden
- The bread should sound hollow when you tap the bottom

### 7. Cool
Let cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes. The crust will keep crackling as it cools — that's the sign of good Cuban bread.

## More Than Just Bread

Cuban bread is a baked cultural document. In its crispy crust lives the history of Ybor City's cigar workers, the creativity of bakers who used palmetto leaves when they didn't have blades, and the stubbornness of a community that never stopped doing things their own way.

Every loaf that comes out of the oven is a reminder: **the best traditions are the simplest ones**.
