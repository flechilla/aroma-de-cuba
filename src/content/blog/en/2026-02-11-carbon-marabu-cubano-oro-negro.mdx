In the Cuban countryside grows a plant that for decades was considered a curse for farmers. Today, that same plant has become **one of Cuba's most valuable export products**: marabu charcoal.

## From Invasive Plant to Black Gold

Marabu (*Dichrostachys cinerea*) arrived in the Caribbean in the 19th century, likely from Africa. What seemed like a harmless shrub became an **agricultural nightmare**: it grows fast, is nearly impossible to eradicate, and has invaded more than **1.5 million hectares** of Cuban land.

But necessity is the mother of invention. Cuban guajiros discovered that this dense, resistant wood produced **exceptional charcoal** when slowly carbonized in artisanal kilns.

## What Makes Marabu Charcoal Special?

The characteristics that have made it a favorite among professional chefs and grillers:

- **High caloric power**: Reaches higher temperatures than other vegetable charcoals
- **Long-lasting**: Burns for **4-5 hours** maintaining constant heat
- **Low smoke**: Clean combustion, ideal for professional kitchens
- **Neutral flavor**: Doesn't alter the natural taste of meats and fish
- **Subtle aroma**: Adds a delicate smoky touch without overpowering

## Traditional Cuban Production

The production process is **completely artisanal** and sustainable:

1. **Selective harvesting**: Farmer cooperatives cut marabu from agricultural fields
2. **Drying**: Wood dries in the sun for weeks
3. **Carbonization**: Burned in traditional earth kilns for 3-7 days
4. **Grading**: Charcoal is sorted by size and quality
5. **Packaging**: Bagged for export using Spanish technology

The main production centers are in **Bayamo**, **Ciego de Ávila**, and **Pinar del Río**.

## Cuba Exports to the World

Cuban marabu charcoal is exported primarily to:

- 🇩🇪 **Germany**: Main European market
- 🇬🇧 **United Kingdom**: High restaurant demand
- 🇪🇸 **Spain**: Growing premium BBQ market
- 🇺🇸 **United States**: Since 2017, first Cuban product after the embargo

Cuba exports between **40,000 and 80,000 tons annually**, generating millions of dollars while recovering agricultural land.

### A Historic Milestone

In January 2017, marabu charcoal became the **first Cuban product exported to the United States** since the embargo was imposed in 1960. [Coabana Trading](https://coabana.com/) achieved this historic agreement with state-owned CubaExport.

## Marabú Restaurant in Miami

Marabu charcoal has even inspired high-end Cuban cuisine. At **Brickell City Centre in Miami**, chef Alberto Cabrera's restaurant [Marabú](https://maraburestaurant.com/) uses Josper ovens fueled by this charcoal to create dishes like:

- Churrasco with charred cherry tomatoes
- 20-ounce cowboy steak with sautéed onions
- Local tuna with grilled pineapple

It's the perfect fusion of Cuban tradition and gastronomic innovation.

## Where to Buy Marabu Charcoal

### In Europe
- [Tienda Biomasa](https://tiendabiomasa.com/) - Spain
- [Brave Charcoal](https://bravecharcoal.com/) - International distribution
- Carbonero - Greece (exports throughout Europe)

### What to Look For
- Certified Cuban origin
- Large pieces ("canelino" or "restaurant grade")
- Low dust content

## Double Environmental Benefit

Marabu charcoal represents a **circular economy model**:

1. **Cleans agricultural land** invaded by the plant
2. **Prevents deforestation** of native trees
3. **Generates income** for farmer cooperatives
4. **Produces clean energy** compared to other fuels

It's a demonstration of how Cuba transforms an environmental problem into an economic opportunity.
