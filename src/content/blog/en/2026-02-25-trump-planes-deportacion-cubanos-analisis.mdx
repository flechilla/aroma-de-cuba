In recent hours, the Donald Trump administration has more clearly outlined its strategy toward the undocumented Cuban community. According to recent reports and statements from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, the approach for 2026 lies not only in mass expulsion but in a rhetoric of "choice" that seeks to pressure migrants into accepting a return to the island as an alternative to prolonged detention.

This shift comes during a February marked by the reactivation of deportation flights operated by ICE Air, which have returned over 300 Cubans so far this year, including—for the first time—ex-convicts with serious crimes that the Havana regime previously refused to accept.

## The "Optional Return" Strategy

The administration has suggested that many Cubans caught in legal limbo, especially those with final orders of removal (I-220B) or denied asylum cases, could face a drastic decision. "Maybe they want to go back. They're going to have that choice," has been the central message.

However, for human rights organizations, this "choice" is illusory, as it is presented under the threat of indefinite imprisonment in ICE detention centers, whose capacity is rapidly expanding to 92,000 beds.

## What Has Changed in Agreements with Havana?

Unlike previous years, migration cooperation between Washington and Havana seems to have entered a phase of intense diplomatic pressure:
- **Acceptance of Criminals:** Cuba has begun receiving flights with passengers who have criminal records in the U.S., something that was historically a point of friction.
- **Frequency:** The goal is to establish a regularity of at least one flight every two weeks to process the backlog of over 45,000 Cubans with firm removal orders.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Who is at the highest risk of deportation right now?
Cubans with a final order of removal (Form I-220B) and those with criminal records, even if they are old. Those who entered under the recently revoked Humanitarian Parole program are also under scrutiny.

### 2. Can a Cuban choose to return "voluntarily"?
Yes, the voluntary departure program allows a migrant to leave the country without being subject to a re-entry ban as severe as that of a formal deportation, but this requires judicial approval.

### 3. How does the recent I-220A ruling affect these deportations?
The Atlanta Court ruling provides procedural protection to those with I-220A (without a deportation order), allowing their residency cases to be reopened and, therefore, temporarily halting their removal.

### 4. What role does the crisis in Cuba play in this plan?
The Trump administration is using the energy and economic crisis on the island as a negotiation lever, linking possible humanitarian relief to the acceptance of a larger flow of deportees.

## Conclusion

The year 2026 marks the end of exceptional treatment for Cuban migrants. The "choice" to return, proposed by Washington, is actually a reminder that legal safeguards are running out. The only path of defense for those in ICE's crosshairs remains the battle in federal courts.
