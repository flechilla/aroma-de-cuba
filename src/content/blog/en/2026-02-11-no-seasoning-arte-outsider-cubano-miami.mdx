An unprecedented exhibition arrives in Miami: **No Seasoning** brings together for the first time the works of seven Afro-descendant Cuban artists working outside the margins of the conventional art world.

## Art from the Margins

The [Copperbridge Foundation](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/no-seasoning-artworks-by-seven-afro-descendant-cuban-outsider-artists-tickets-1981617105105) in North Miami will host this historic show, curated by renowned Cuban art critic **Elvia Rosa Castro**. It is the first exhibition of its kind to be presented in this city.

The participating artists are:
- **Pedro Pablo Bacallao Perdomo**
- **Gloria de la Caridad García**
- **Misleidys Castillo**
- **Isaac Crespo**
- **Daldo Marte**
- **Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara**
- **Martha Iris Pérez Santana**

## The Double Stigma

What makes this exhibition unique is that it addresses two layers of marginalization these artists face: **racial discrimination** as Afro-descendants in Cuba, and the **stigma associated with outsider art** - artists who create outside established cultural and institutional norms.

As curator Castro explains, these creators live in "extremely vulnerable conditions and systemic disadvantages." Their art, however, transcends these limitations with a visual power that defies stereotypes.

## Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara: Art as Resistance

Among the featured artists is [Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Manuel_Otero_Alc%C3%A1ntara), founder of the **San Isidro Movement** and one of the most recognized voices in Cuban artistic activism. In 2021, [Time magazine](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2021/) named him among the 100 most influential people in the world.

Otero Alcántara, a self-taught artist born in Havana's San Isidro neighborhood, has been arrested multiple times for his performances criticizing the Cuban government. He is currently serving a five-year sentence in a maximum-security prison in Guanajay. [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/) declared him a prisoner of conscience in 2021.

His early works included sculptures of human figures, animals, and comic book characters created from salvaged materials - a perfect example of Cuban outsider art ingenuity.

## A Breath of Authenticity

The title **No Seasoning** encapsulates the show's philosophy. Castro describes it as a "ten-minute stop" - a moment of respite and pure authenticity in a world dominated by:

- Standardization
- Censorship
- Logocentrism
- Rigid social conventions
- Persistent colonial structures

It is, according to the curator, an exhibition of "radical nakedness" in the sense of honesty, transparency, and absence of socio-cultural rituals.

## Beyond Collage

The presented works span multiple media:
- **Collage**
- **Drawing**
- **Sculpture**
- **Photography**

Each piece offers a resilient, exceptional, and non-stereotypical vision of how these artists confront their reality. The works come from the **NAEMI Collection** (National Art Exhibitions of the Mentally Ill), thanks to the support of Juan Martin, NAEMI's Executive Director.

## Special Programming

In addition to the exhibition, complementary events will be held:

**Panel Discussion - March 4, 2026**
"Channeling Wellness Through the Arts" - Elvia Rosa Castro will converse with Silvia Quintana, CEO of Broward Behavioral Health Coalition, about how art contributes to wellness and recovery.

**Drumming Circle - May 22, 2026**
The South Florida Wellness Network will conduct a participatory percussion experience led by a person in recovery, marking the exhibition's closing.

## A Necessary Window

In times when Cuba faces an [unprecedented economic crisis](/en/blog/feria-libro-habana-pospuesta-crisis/), exhibitions like No Seasoning serve a vital function: they give international visibility to Cuban artistic voices that would otherwise remain silenced.

Outsider art, by definition, exists outside systems of power. These seven Afro-descendant Cuban artists demonstrate that the most authentic creativity often emerges precisely from those margins.
