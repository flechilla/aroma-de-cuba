A second deportation flight landed in Havana on February 19, 2026, carrying **116 Cuban migrants**, according to Cuba's Ministry of Interior (MININT). This operation brings the total number of repatriated individuals in 2026 to **302**.

## The Numbers Behind the Second Flight

The deported group consisted of **88 men and 28 women** who arrived at José Martí International Airport in Havana. According to the MININT's official statement, the operation was carried out "in compliance with bilateral migration agreements" between Cuba and the United States.

This is the second confirmed deportation flight of 2026, following the [first flight on February 9 that carried 170 Cubans](/en/blog/2026-02-19-cuba-acepta-deportados-delitos-graves-primera-vez), including for the first time individuals convicted of serious crimes such as murder, rape, and drug trafficking.

## An Unprecedented Pace of Deportations

The figures reveal a significant acceleration:

- **Full year 2025**: 1,669 migrants deported to Cuba from the U.S. and other countries
- **January–February 2026**: 302 repatriated in just two months
- **Annual projection**: at this rate, 2026 deportations could exceed 1,800

The contrast is even more striking considering that all of January 2026 passed without any deportation flights. Both flights were concentrated in February, suggesting an intensification of operations under the [current Trump administration immigration policy](/en/blog/2026-02-13-trump-acuerdo-cuba-migracion).

## Fewer Arrivals, More Deportations

According to [Customs and Border Protection (CBP)](https://www.cbp.gov/) data, Cuban arrivals to the United States have plummeted:

| Period | Cubans Arriving in U.S. |
|--------|------------------------|
| Fiscal Year 2024 | 217,615 |
| Fiscal Year 2025 | 33,056 |

This **85% drop** reflects the combined impact of the [closure of the Nicaraguan route](/en/blog/2026-02-16-nicaragua-exige-visa-128-paises-cubanos), the termination of the CHNV humanitarian parole program, and the overall tightening of immigration policies.

## The 16 Unaccounted Deportations

A noteworthy detail: while the two confirmed flights total 286 people (170 + 116), the MININT reports 302. The **16 additional cases** have not been publicly detailed and may correspond to returns from third countries or maritime interceptions.

Between the two flights, [Cuban rafters were rescued](/en/blog/2026-02-17-balseros-cubanos-rescatados-mar-caribe) in Caribbean waters, including a group rescued by a Royal Caribbean cruise ship and handed over to Cayman Islands authorities.

## What This Means for Cubans in the U.S.

With approximately [45,000 Cubans facing pending deportation orders](/en/blog/2026-02-11-cubanos-deportacion-eeuu-crisis) and Havana's new willingness to accept even individuals with criminal records, the Cuban community in the United States faces an increasingly uncertain landscape.

The [class-action lawsuit over I-220A forms](/en/blog/2026-02-17-i220a-demanda-colectiva-500mil-cubanos) affecting nearly 500,000 Cubans could prove decisive in the coming months.
