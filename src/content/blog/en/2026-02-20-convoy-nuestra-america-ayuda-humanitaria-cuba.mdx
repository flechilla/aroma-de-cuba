The **"Nuestra América"** initiative, organized by a coalition of international movements, has grown from a maritime flotilla into a **coordinated convoy by air, sea, and land** planning to converge on Havana's Malecón on **March 21, 2026**.

## From flotilla to convoy: solidarity overflows

What started as a flotilla inspired by humanitarian missions to Gaza has become something much larger. According to organizers, the international response was so overwhelming they decided to expand the operation.

> "In response to the overwhelming global solidarity with Cuba, the flotilla has become a coordinated convoy by air, land, and sea," they said in a statement.

The convoy will deliver **food, medicine, medical supplies, and essential goods** to the island, which is experiencing the [most severe crisis in decades](/en/blog/2026-02-20-crisis-basura-habana-cuba-emergencia-sanitaria) following the tightening of the U.S. oil blockade.

## High-profile international support

The initiative has drawn backing from prominent figures:

- **[Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg)**, Swedish environmental activist, who stated: *"The United States is committing a brutal act of collective punishment against the Cuban people right now. I support this convoy because international solidarity is the only force powerful enough to stand up to imperial figures like Trump."*

- **[Rashida Tlaib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib)**, U.S. Democratic congresswoman.

- Delegations from **labor unions, legislators, humanitarian organizations, and public figures** from multiple countries.

## Inspired by the Gaza flotilla

Several convoy organizers previously participated in the **Sumud Flotilla**, which has attempted to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinian territories amid the Israeli siege. The connection between both causes has resonated strongly among international solidarity movements.

## Cuba at its worst point in 67 years

The convoy comes at a critical moment. Since the Trump administration [imposed additional sanctions](/en/blog/2026-02-20-cuba-preparada-bloqueo-total-onu) on countries supplying oil to Cuba, and following the intervention in Venezuela that cut crude shipments, the island faces:

- **Prolonged blackouts** with deficits approaching [2,000 MW](/en/blog/2026-02-11-guiteras-power-plant-fails-2000-mw-deficit)
- **Severe rationing** of fuel and food
- **Minimal services** in healthcare, transportation, and education
- **Health crisis** from garbage accumulation in the streets

The [United Nations expressed concern](https://news.un.org/en/) last week about the shortage and announced it is working with the Cuban government to provide greater support.

## What to expect

Organizers continue establishing **collection points** in multiple countries, coordinating the procurement of essential supplies, and refining logistics for the simultaneous arrival via all three routes.

The **March 21** date — coinciding with the start of spring — aims to symbolize a message of renewal and hope for the 11 million Cubans facing the worst crisis since the embargo was first imposed.
