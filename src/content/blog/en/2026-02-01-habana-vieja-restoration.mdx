The restoration work in Old Havana's Plaza Vieja has revealed an
extraordinary find: beneath more than a dozen layers of modern paint,
a team of conservators has discovered 18th-century frescoes depicting
scenes of colonial Cuban life.

The discovery, announced by the Office of the City Historian,
confirms what many experts suspected: Havana's colonial buildings
harbor hidden artistic treasures beneath decades of poorly planned
interventions.

## A Find Beneath Layers of Time

The restoration team, composed of Cuban specialists and collaborators
from the Getty Conservation Institute, worked for six months to
document and stabilize the frescoes before making them public.

  Plaza Vieja was founded in 1559 as Plaza Nueva. For centuries it
  served as the center of Havana's social and commercial life.
  In the 20th century it suffered severe deterioration, and its
  restoration began in the 1990s.

## What's Next

Authorities plan to open a permanent exhibition hall in the same
building where the frescoes were found, allowing the public to see
the restored works in their original context.

The project is part of a broader effort to preserve Havana's
architectural heritage, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.
Experts estimate that hundreds of buildings still remain to be explored
in search of similar hidden art.
