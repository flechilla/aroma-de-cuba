In a dramatic development of Cuba's energy crisis, **Air Canada and WestJet have suspended all operations to the island** and begun sending empty planes from Montreal and Toronto to rescue approximately **3,000 stranded Canadian tourists**.

## Aerial Rescue Operation

The decision comes after Cuban aviation authorities notified that **no Jet A-1 fuel will be available** at Cuba's nine international airports from February 10 until at least March 11, 2026.

> "Both airlines said they would send empty jets to Cuba from Montreal and Toronto to bring back roughly 3,000 Canadians currently visiting the island."
> — *The New York Times*

Air Canada, which operates a significant portion of tourist flights to Cuba, announced a **complete suspension of operations until May**. WestJet has also halted its routes to the Caribbean destination.

## Blow to Winter Tourism

Cuban beaches are a crucial winter destination for Canadian tourists, representing one of the **most important sources of hard currency** for the Cuban government. The island's tourism industry generated approximately **$3 billion in annual revenue** before this crisis.

### Airlines Affected Internationally

The crisis has forced adjustments from airlines worldwide:

- **Air Canada and WestJet**: Total suspension, rescue operations underway
- **Southwest Airlines**: Continues operating, but each plane carries enough fuel for round trip
- **American Airlines**: "Closely monitoring the situation"
- **Delta Air Lines**: No reported disruptions, though evaluating options
- **European and Russian airlines**: Evaluating stopovers in Dominican Republic or Cancún for refueling

## Crisis Context

The oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration has **effectively cut off Cuba's access to its traditional fuel sources**:

1. **Venezuela**: Shipments interrupted since December following tariff threats
2. **Mexico**: President Sheinbaum announced pause in oil shipments while seeking alternatives
3. **Russia**: Has criticized the situation but hasn't confirmed emergency shipments

### Extreme Austerity Measures

Alongside the aviation crisis, Cuba has implemented:

- University closures
- Reduced bank hours
- 4-day work week for state entities
- Suspension of cultural events
- Virtual paralysis of Havana's public bus system

## What's Next?

Stranded Canadian tourists are receiving instructions to contact their airlines to reschedule repatriation flights. The rescue operation is expected to be completed in the coming days.

Meanwhile, the question persists: **how long can Cuba sustain itself under these conditions?**
