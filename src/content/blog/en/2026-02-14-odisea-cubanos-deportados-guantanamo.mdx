  - question: "Did the deportees know they were going to Guantánamo?"

  - question: "What conditions do detained Cubans face at Guantánamo?"
    answer: "Testimonies describe blindfolds to prevent knowledge of their exact location, handcuffs and leg shackles, delayed medical attention, and isolation in Camp 6 facilities."
  - question: "Why does the U.S. deport Cubans to Guantánamo instead of Havana?"
    answer: "The Trump administration has used the naval base as an immigration detention center, avoiding direct coordination with the Cuban government for repatriations and keeping deportees in a territorial limbo."

## From Louisiana to Guantánamo: the lie that changed everything

An investigation published by [El País](https://elpais.com/us/migracion/2026-02-14/de-luisiana-a-guantanamo-para-llegar-a-la-habana-la-odisea-de-los-primeros-cubanos-deportados-a-la-base-militar-de-estados-unidos.html) reveals the harrowing testimonies of more than 50 Cubans who were deported to the Guantánamo naval base believing they were returning to Havana. Their accounts paint a picture of deception, uncertainty, and conditions that human rights organizations call unacceptable.

## The night of December 14

On December 14, 2025, guards at the Alexandria Staging Facility detention center in Louisiana told 22 Cubans — men between 20 and 50 years old — they would be deported. Families celebrated: after months of imprisonment, their loved ones would come home.

**Arelys Piloto**, mother of 22-year-old Alexander Peraza, received the call in Miami: *"I'm leaving now,"* her son told her happily, after nearly 12 months in ICE custody. **Daysi Alfonso** arranged a car to pick up her nephew Maykel Rivera at José Martí airport. Rivera's children *"were excited about their dad's arrival."*

None of them made it to Havana.

## Welcome to Guantánamo

After more than two hours of flight, the deportees landed and read a sign welcoming them to the **Guantánamo Bay Naval Base** — the U.S. military enclave in Cuba since 1903. They were in their country, but they weren't.

What followed was even more disturbing:

- **Blindfolds** to prevent them from seeing the facilities
- **Handcuffs and leg shackles** during transfers
- **Detention in Camp 6**, the same facility that has housed prisoners accused of terrorism
- **Delayed medical care**: when Vladimir Gago Soriano — a man with eight surgeries on one leg — slipped in the showers, authorities took an hour to respond

## Three flights, 54 deportees

According to [ICE Flight Monitor](https://elpais.com/us/migracion/2026-02-14/) data, the Trump administration sent at least three flights with Cubans to Guantánamo:

| Flight | Date | Deportees |
|--------|------|-----------|
| First | December 14, 2025 | 22 Cubans |
| Second | December 19, 2025 | ~16 Cubans |
| Third | January 9, 2026 | ~16 Cubans |

In total, at least **54 Cuban citizens** have been sent to the military base.

## No criminal records

One of the most controversial aspects is the profile of the deportees. According to families interviewed by El País, many **had no criminal records**:

- Alexander Peraza worked at Miami's famous **Palacio de los Jugos**
- Maykel Rivera worked at a **cabinet factory**
- Marcos Alejandro Ávila, 25, had signed his **voluntary departure since October**

For the families, although deportation was painful, it represented relief from months of imprisonment. *"Freedom in their country was better than imprisonment in ICE jails,"* where more than **70,000 migrants** remain detained today.

## A pattern of escalation

These testimonies add to a series of [increasingly aggressive immigration measures](/en/blog/deportaciones-terceros-paises-40-millones/) by the Trump administration against Cubans, including:

- [Third-country deportations](/en/blog/deportaciones-terceros-paises-40-millones/) costing $40 million
- The [death of a Cuban in ICE detention](/en/blog/geraldo-lunas-campos-homicidio-ice/) classified as homicide
- [Florida paying millions to police](/en/blog/florida-policia-ice-cubanos/) for ICE collaboration
- Rising [self-deportations](/en/blog/autodeportacion-cubanos-ice/) as an alternative to indefinite detention

## What happens now?

The situation of Cubans at Guantánamo remains uncertain. Cuba is going through [one of its worst economic crises](https://elpais.com/america/2026-02-05/cuba-anuncia-recortes-severos-similares-a-los-del-periodo-especial-para-afrontar-la-asfixia-de-estados-unidos.html), with cuts similar to the Special Period. Deportees arrive in a country where shortages of food, medicine, and electricity are the norm.

Organizations like the **ACLU** and **Human Rights First** have demanded transparency about conditions at Guantánamo and questioned the legality of using a military base as an immigration detention center.
