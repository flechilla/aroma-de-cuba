# EGREM and Cuban Music Labels: Complete Guide to the Island's Musical Catalog

Cuba has gifted the world some of its most influential musical genres: **son cubano**, **mambo**, **cha-cha-chá**, **bolero**, **nueva trova**, and **timba**. Behind these legendary recordings are record labels that preserved and spread this sonic heritage. The most important of all is **EGREM**, the guardian of Cuba's most extensive musical catalog.

## EGREM: Cuba's National Record Label

### History and founding

The **Empresa de Grabaciones y Ediciones Musicales (EGREM)** was founded in **1964**, following the nationalization of Cuba's music industry. It absorbed the assets of **Panart**, Cuba's first independent record label founded in 1944 by Ramón Sabat.

From its headquarters at **Calle San Miguel No. 410, Centro Habana**, EGREM maintained a monopoly on Cuban music production for over two decades, until the late 1980s when independent labels began to reemerge.

> "EGREM holds the most extensive catalog of Cuban music in the world" — a sound library spanning from the 1940s to the present day.

### Estudios Areíto: Where the magic was born

The **Estudios Areíto** (101 and 102) are EGREM's beating heart. Located in Havana, these studios have recorded virtually every Cuban artist who remained on the island, from [Orquesta Aragón](https://www.ecured.cu/Orquesta_Arag%C3%B3n) to [Rubén González](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rub%C3%A9n-gonz%C3%A1lez-mn0000298036).

Until 1996, all recordings from the Havana studios were released under the **Areíto** sub-label, a name that has become synonymous with classic Cuban music.

### Iconic EGREM artists

EGREM's catalog includes recordings from giants of Cuban music:

- **Bola de Nieve** — Piano and vocal genius
- **Orquesta Aragón** — Masters of cha-cha-chá
- **Joseíto Fernández** — Creator of *Guantanamera*
- **Elena Burke** — La Señora Sentimiento (The Lady of Feeling)
- **Barbarito Díez** — Voice of the Cuban danzón
- **Adalberto Álvarez y su Son** — The Gentleman of Son
- **Rubén González** — Legendary pianist of the [Buena Vista Social Club](/en/blog/2026-01-20-musica-cubana-grammy/)
- **Estrellas de Areíto** — The Cuban supergroup of the 1970s

## Other Cuban Labels and Sub-Labels

### Siboney (Santiago de Cuba)

Active from the early 1980s to 1996, the **Siboney** sub-label released recordings made at EGREM's studios in **Santiago de Cuba**, the capital of son music. Its catalogs include essential eastern Cuban music.

### Palma and Guamá (international distribution)

In the 1960s, EGREM created **Palma** to distribute Cuban records internationally. In the 1970s, it was replaced by **Guamá**, which marketed Cuban music around the world for decades.

### Bis Music

One of the most important independent labels that emerged after EGREM's monopoly ended. It has recorded contemporary [timba, Cuban jazz, and fusion](https://www.allmusic.com/style/cuban-jazz-ma0000012018) artists.

### Panart: The pioneer

Before EGREM, there was **Panart** (1944), founded by Ramón Sabat. It was the first label to record Cuban artists on the island with modern technology. Its legacy was absorbed by EGREM after the revolution.

## The Buena Vista Social Club Phenomenon

No history of Cuban discography would be complete without mentioning the album that revolutionized global perception of Cuban music. Recorded in 1996 at the **Estudios Areíto** by British label [World Circuit Records](https://www.worldcircuit.co.uk/), *Buena Vista Social Club* sold millions of copies and won a Grammy.

Producer **Ry Cooder** brought together veterans like **Ibrahim Ferrer**, **Compay Segundo**, **Omara Portuondo**, and **Rubén González** — many of them EGREM artists who had been forgotten. The album proved the incalculable value of Cuba's musical catalog.

## Where to Buy Cuban Music

## Cuban Vinyl as Collector's Items

Original **Areíto** and **EGREM** records have become highly sought-after collector's pieces. What makes them special:

- **Artistic covers** designed by Cuban graphic artists
- **Limited pressings** due to material scarcity in Cuba
- **Analog sound** recorded at the legendary Estudios Areíto
- **Historical value**: they document musical genres unique to the world

An original vinyl of **Estrellas de Areíto** or **Bola de Nieve** in good condition can fetch $50-200 USD on the collector's market.

## Casas de la Música

EGREM doesn't just record music — it presents it live. The **Casas de la Música** are venues managed by EGREM in several Cuban cities where label artists perform. The most famous are in:

- **Centro Habana** (Galiano corner of Neptuno)
- **Miramar** (Calle 20 corner of 35)
- **Santiago de Cuba**
- **Trinidad**

They're the ideal place to experience live Cuban music, from [traditional son](/en/blog/2026-01-20-musica-cubana-grammy/) to modern timba.

## The Future of Cuban Discography

The EGREM-Sony Music alliance opened new doors for Cuban music in the global market. At the same time, a new generation of Cuban artists is creating music that fuses tradition with contemporary sounds, recording both in EGREM studios and independent facilities inside and outside the island.

The worldwide **vinyl revival** has also benefited EGREM's catalog, with reissues of classic recordings finding new audiences among young collectors fascinated by Cuba's authentic sound.
