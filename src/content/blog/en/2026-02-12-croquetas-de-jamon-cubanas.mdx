faq:
  - question: "What is the secret ingredient in Cuban croquetas?"
    answer: "Nutmeg. While Spanish croquetas rely on jamón serrano, Cuban croquetas add nutmeg to the béchamel sauce, giving them a unique, recognizable flavor that sets them apart from any other version."
  - question: "Can you bake Cuban croquetas instead of frying?"
    answer: "Yes, you can bake them at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, spraying them with oil. They won't be identical to fried ones, but they're a lighter alternative that preserves the creamy filling."
  - question: "Why do Cuban croquetas use sweet ham instead of serrano?"
    answer: "Cuba didn't produce dry-cured ham like Spain's jamón serrano. Cubans adapted the Spanish recipe using sweet ham (cooking ham) and even canned deviled ham, creating a milder, more accessible version that became its own tradition."
  - question: "How long can you store croquetas before frying?"
    answer: "The refrigerated dough lasts 2-3 days. Once formed and breaded, you can freeze them on trays separated by wax paper for up to 3 months. Fry them straight from frozen — no thawing needed."

Some bites tell the story of an entire people in a single crunch. The **Cuban croqueta de jamón** is one of them: crispy outside, creamy inside, and loaded with a history that crosses oceans and generations.

## From France to Spain, from Spain to Cuba

The [croquette was born in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette) in the 18th century, likely in the kitchen of chef Antoine Carême. The name comes from the French *croquer* — to crunch. But it was Spain that adopted them with passion, replacing the original potato filling with a **thick béchamel loaded with jamón serrano** that became a national tapa.

When the Spanish came to Cuba, the croquetas traveled with them. But the island, as it does with everything, transformed them. Without access to cured serrano ham, Cubans used **sweet ham** — the cooking ham found in any bodega. And they added one ingredient that changed everything: **nutmeg**.

That pinch of nutmeg in the béchamel is what separates a Cuban croqueta from any other in the world.

## The Traditional Recipe

### Ingredients (makes about 30 croquetas)

**For the dough:**
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 250g (1/2 lb) sweet ham, finely diced (or 2 cans [deviled ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviled_ham))
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Pinch of garlic powder

**For breading:**
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup fine breadcrumbs (Cuban cracker meal preferred)
- Vegetable oil for frying

### Instructions

**1. The Cuban béchamel**

Melt butter over medium heat in a heavy skillet. Add all the flour at once and stir constantly with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes — you want a blond roux, not golden. Add milk gradually, never stopping the stirring. Patience is everything here.

**2. The soul: ham and nutmeg**

When the béchamel thickens (it should pull away from the sides of the pan), fold in the diced ham, nutmeg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir for 2-3 more minutes. The dough should be thick like soft clay.

**3. Chill — the step you cannot skip**

Pour the dough onto a greased tray, cover with plastic wrap touching the surface (to prevent a skin from forming), and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours**, ideally overnight. This is every Cuban grandmother's secret: cold dough shapes without sticking.

**4. Shape and bread**

With slightly damp hands, take portions of dough and roll into cylinders about 3 inches long. Dip each croqueta in beaten egg, then roll in breadcrumbs, ensuring full coverage. For extra crunch, double-bread: egg and crumbs twice.

**5. Fry to perfection**

Heat oil to 350°F (175°C). Fry croquetas in small batches, 3-4 minutes, turning until **evenly golden**. Drain on paper towels.

## Croquetas in Miami: An Industry Born of Exile

When hundreds of thousands of Cubans arrived in Miami in the 1960s, croquetas were among the first things to appear in the *ventanitas* (walk-up windows) of [Calle Ocho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calle_Ocho). Bakeries like **Karla Bakery**, **Vicky Bakery**, and **Sergio's** built empires on this humble snack.

In Miami, the croqueta transcended food. It's late-night fuel, office snack, mandatory companion to [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuban-coffee-cafecito-history-recipe/). There is no family reunion, birthday party, or funeral in Cuban Miami without a tray of croquetas.

The tradition evolved too: today you'll find chicken, fish, cheese, even [ropa vieja](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ropa-vieja-cubana/) croquetas. But ham remains the undisputed queen.

## Modern Variations Without Losing the Essence

- **Croqueta preparada**: inside Cuban bread with mustard — Miami's ultimate snack
- **Chicken croquetas**: the second most popular, using shredded boiled chicken
- **Baked croquetas**: lighter alternative, baked at 400°F with oil spray
- **Cheese-stuffed croquetas**: with a cream cheese core that melts when you bite

## The Sacred Ritual: Cafecito and Croqueta

If there's one holy pairing in Cuban Miami culture, it's the **cortadito with croqueta**. The bitterness of espresso against the salty creaminess of the croqueta creates a contrast no Cuban can resist. It's the breakfast of the ventanitas, the 3 PM snack, the bite that tastes like home no matter how many years you've been away from the island.

As they say on [Calle Ocho](https://littlehavanafoodtours.com/): *"If you haven't had a croqueta with cafecito, you haven't lived Miami."*
