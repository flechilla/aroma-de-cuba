Some cookies you eat. Others you remember. **Torticas de Morón** belong firmly in the second category — a crisp, crumbly bite that dissolves on your tongue, releasing the unmistakable perfume of **fresh lime zest** that is pure Cuban tropics.

Born in the city of [Morón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mor%C3%B3n,_Cuba), in **Ciego de Ávila** province, these cookies are a cornerstone of Cuban baking. With just five ingredients and a technique any Cuban grandmother has mastered, torticas de Morón prove that culinary greatness needs no complications.

## The Origin: Morón, City of the Rooster

Morón is famous for two things: its **Rooster of Morón** — the sculpture that greets visitors at the city entrance — and its torticas. Nestled in central Cuba among sugarcane fields and citrus groves, the city had the perfect conditions for this recipe to be born: abundant lard from rural pig farming and **lime trees** growing in every backyard.

The recipe passed through generations of local bakers. Some culinary historians link them to the **Spanish polvorones** that arrived during the colonial era, but the addition of lime zest made them something entirely Cuban. Where the Andalusian polvorón uses cinnamon, the tortica de Morón uses Caribbean citrus.

Over time, the torticas spread beyond Ciego de Ávila. Today you'll find them in bakeries across [Havana](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-01-habana-vieja-restauracion-patrimonio/), at the ventanitas of Miami, and in diaspora kitchens worldwide, where making them is an act of nostalgia and love.

## Ingredients

This recipe yields approximately **24-30 cookies**, depending on your cutter size.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|---|---|
| Lard (or unsalted butter) | 225 g (½ pound) |
| White sugar | 1 cup (200 g) |
| All-purpose flour, sifted | 4 cups (480 g) |
| Lime zest | 1 whole lime |
| Vanilla extract | 1 teaspoon |
| Powdered sugar for dusting | To taste |

### Ingredient Notes

**Lard** is the secret to authentic texture. It's what makes the tortica crumble perfectly when you bite it, like a flawless shortbread. If you can't find it, unsalted butter works, but the experience will be different.

**Lime zest** (limón criollo in Cuba) is non-negotiable. Don't use lemon or orange — the fragrance of lime is what sets torticas de Morón apart from every other cookie in the world.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Cream the Lard and Sugar

In a large bowl, mix room-temperature lard with sugar. Work with a wooden spoon until you get a pale, fluffy cream. This takes about **5-8 minutes** by hand — patience here defines the final texture.

### 2. Add the Lime and Vanilla

Zest the lime directly over the mixture. Only the green part — the white pith is bitter. Add the vanilla and mix well. At this point, your kitchen fills with an aroma that is pure Cuba.

### 3. Incorporate the Flour

Add sifted flour in three batches, mixing gently after each addition. The dough should be **soft, pliable, and not sticky**. If too sticky, add flour one tablespoon at a time. If too dry, a teaspoon of cold water.

### 4. Roll and Cut

On a floured surface, roll the dough to **half-centimeter thickness**. Use a round cutter to shape the cookies and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced a couple of centimeters apart.

### 5. Bake

Bake in a preheated oven at **180°C (350°F)** for **15-20 minutes**. The torticas should be barely golden at the edges — don't let them darken too much. They'll be soft out of the oven and firm up as they cool.

### 6. Dust with Powdered Sugar

Once warm (not hot), dust generously with **powdered sugar**. This isn't decoration — it's an essential part of the flavor. The white cloud of sugar over the golden cookie is the classic image of torticas de Morón.

## Variations and Family Secrets

Like any self-respecting Cuban recipe, torticas de Morón have as many versions as families who make them:

- **With shredded coconut**: Some families in eastern Cuba add fine shredded coconut, connecting this recipe to the coconut traditions of [Baracoa](https://aromadecuba.com/en/blog/2026-02-13-dulce-de-coco-cubano/).
- **With almonds**: A more refined variant that incorporates ground almonds for a denser texture and richer flavor.
- **With butter**: The diaspora version, where butter replaces the lard that isn't always easy to find abroad.
- **Half-moon shaped**: Some Havana bakeries make them as half-moons instead of rounds.

## Torticas in Cuban Culture

In Morón, torticas aren't just a dessert — they're a **badge of local identity**. They appear at food festivals, at [Mother's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day) celebrations, and as a mandatory gift when someone visits from out of town.

For the Cuban diaspora, making torticas de Morón is a ritual of memory. Every lime zested, every tray pulled from the oven, is a conversation with the grandmother who taught the recipe, with the neighborhood bakery that no longer exists, with a Cuba that lives on in the palate.

## Perfect Pairings

Torticas de Morón practically demand a strong [Cuban coffee](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuban-coffee-cafecito-history-recipe/). The intensity of a cafecito contrasts perfectly with the cookie's gentle sweetness. They also pair beautifully with:

- **Hot chocolate** on cool afternoons
- A **mamey milkshake** for double the cubanía
- **Sweet wine** as an after-dinner treat

## A Small Bite with an Enormous Soul

Torticas de Morón are proof that Cuban baking needs no exotic ingredients or French techniques to create something unforgettable. Five ingredients, an oven, and the zest of a green lime are enough to travel to Ciego de Ávila without leaving your kitchen.

Make them, share them, and when someone asks what's in them, tell them what every Cuban grandmother knows: **lard, flour, sugar, lime, and love**. Especially the love.
