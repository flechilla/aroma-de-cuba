faq:
  - question: "What is the secret ingredient in Cuban croquettes?"
    answer: "Nutmeg is the distinctive touch that sets Cuban croquettes apart from other versions. It's mixed directly into the béchamel along with the ham, adding an unmistakable aromatic flavor."
  - question: "Can Cuban croquettes be baked instead of fried?"
    answer: "Yes, you can bake them at 400°F for 20-25 minutes with a light spray of oil. They won't be as crispy as fried ones, but they're a lighter alternative."
  - question: "How long do Cuban croquettes last in the freezer?"
    answer: "Uncooked breaded croquettes keep for up to 3 months in the freezer. Freeze them on a tray first before transferring to bags so they don't stick together."
  - question: "What kind of ham is used for Cuban croquettes?"
    answer: "Traditionally, cooked ham (leg ham) is used, finely chopped or ground. In Miami, many Cuban families use canned deviled ham, which gives a more concentrated flavor."

**Cuban ham croquettes** are far more than an appetizer — they're a piece of cultural identity. From the cafeterías of Havana to the ventanitas of Miami, these golden bites have been part of Cuban life for generations, turning any moment into a small celebration.

## From Spain to Cuba: A Culinary Love Story

Croquettes arrived in Cuba from Spain in the 19th century, but like everything that touches the island, they were transformed into something uniquely Cuban. While the Spanish fill theirs with cod or chicken, Cubans adopted **ham** as the star filling, creating a creamier, more aromatic version that would become a symbol of criolla cooking.

The Cuban secret lies in **nutmeg** — that aromatic touch that, according to the abuelas, [makes the difference between a good croqueta and an unforgettable one](https://heartofhomemade.com/croquetas-de-jamon-cuban-ham-croquettes/).

## Recipe: Cuban Ham Croquettes

### Ingredients (makes about 30 croquettes)

**For the dough:**
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk (warm)
- 1/2 pound cooked ham, very finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper to taste

**For breading:**
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup fine breadcrumbs
- Vegetable oil for frying

### Step by Step

1. **The Cuban béchamel:** Melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes until a golden paste (the roux) forms.

2. **Add the milk:** Pour in the warm milk gradually, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan.

3. **The soul:** Mix in the chopped ham, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Stir until fully combined.

4. **Chill:** Spread the mixture onto a greased plate, cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface (to prevent a skin forming), and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours**, ideally overnight.

5. **Shape:** With slightly damp hands, take portions and roll into cylinders about 2.5 inches long.

6. **Bread:** Dip each croquette in beaten egg, then breadcrumbs. Repeat the process twice for an extra crispy crust.

7. **Fry:** In oil heated to 350°F, fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes until golden on all sides. Drain on paper towels.

## Tips from a Cuban Kitchen

- **Deviled ham shortcut:** Many Cuban families in exile [use canned deviled ham](https://asassyspoon.com/ham-croquettes/) as a shortcut, and the result is surprisingly authentic.
- **Double breading:** The secret to perfect texture is coating twice in egg and breadcrumbs.
- **Oil temperature matters:** Too cool and the croquettes absorb oil. Too hot and they brown outside while staying raw inside.

## Croquettes in Cuban Culture

In Miami, croquettes are [an institution](https://familiakitchen.com/croquetas-de-jamon-cuban-ham-croquettes-with-mayoketchup/). The famous **ventanita** — that little walk-up window where you order a cafecito and croquetas — is a sacred ritual for the Cuban community. There's no more perfect snack than a hot croqueta paired with a **strong Cuban coffee**.

If you love Cuban flavors, try our [ropa vieja, the national dish](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ropa-vieja-cubana/) or the classic [Cuban tostones](/en/blog/2026-02-11-tostones-cubanos-receta-tradicion/). And to wash it down, nothing beats a [Cuban coffee with its signature espumita](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cafe-cubano-historia-receta-espuma/).

## What to Serve With Them

Cuban croquettes are great on their own, but they also shine with:
- **Mayoketchup** (mayo + ketchup) — Miami's favorite dipping sauce
- **Spicy mango salsa** — for the adventurous
- **Fresh lime squeeze** — simple and perfect
- **A cafecito** — the most Cuban combo that exists
