# Cimafunk: The Cuban James Brown Conquering the World

**Afro-Cuban funk has a new king, and he comes from Pinar del Río.** [Erik Alejandro Iglesias Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimafunk), known worldwide as Cimafunk, has just proven once again why he's considered the most innovative Cuban artist of his generation.

This February 2026, **Jam Cruise 22** set sail from Miami with Cimafunk as the headlining act for the sail-away party. Critics were unanimous: *"the Cuban James Brown on steroids,"* wrote [Music Fest News](https://www.musicfestnews.com/). His band **La Tribu** transformed the cruise ship's Pool Deck into a Caribbean celebration that passengers won't soon forget.

## From Medicine to Funk: An Unexpected Path

Cimafunk's story defies every cliché. Born in 1989 in [Pinar del Río](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo), Cuba's westernmost province, Erik grew up singing in church and studying to become a doctor like several members of his family.

But music called too strongly. In 2010, with just two years of medical school completed, he made a life-changing decision: **he abandoned medicine and moved to Havana** to pursue his musical dream.

> "Music was my true medicine," the artist has confessed in interviews.

For years he worked as an arranger and producer for established Cuban artists like [Raúl Paz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Paz) and Liuba María Hevia. From 2014 to 2016, he was part of the influential band [Interactivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivo_(band)), absorbing influences and refining his artistic vision.

## Birth of a Modern Maroon

The name **Cimafunk** is no accident. It's a tribute to the [cimarrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroons) (maroons), African slaves who escaped Cuban plantations during colonial times to form free communities in the mountains.

That connection to ancestral Afro-Cuban resistance defines his musical vision: **an explosive fusion of American funk, hip hop, and traditional Afro-Caribbean rhythms**. It's music that liberates, resists, and celebrates.

His debut album **Terapia** (2017) was a statement of intent. But it was with the single *"Me Voy"* (2018) that Cimafunk captured international attention, accumulating millions of plays and opening doors to festivals across the United States and Europe.

## El Alimento: Grammy Nomination and Legendary Collaborations

The turning point came in 2021 with **El Alimento**, an album that fused the best of Cuban music with American funk legends:

- **[George Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(funk_musician))** - The godfather of P-Funk
- **[CeeLo Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeLo_Green)** - Iconic voice of modern soul
- **[Lupe Fiasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_Fiasco)** - Conscious hip hop innovator

The result was a **Grammy nomination** for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album. Both [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/) included *El Alimento* among the year's best albums.

## Pa' Tu Cuerpa: The New Orleans Chapter

Since 2022, Cimafunk has established his base in **New Orleans**, a city where African, Caribbean, and American roots intertwine in unique ways. There he reorganized his band under the name **La Tribu** (The Tribe).

His latest album, **Pa' Tu Cuerpa** (2024), continues exploring Afro-Cuban funk with new collaborations, including New Orleans jazz master [Trombone Shorty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombone_Shorty).

## Jam Cruise 2026: The Conquest Continues

Cimafunk's performance at **Jam Cruise 22** this February proved his star continues to rise. According to festival coverage:

> "Singing mostly in Spanish, just one day before Bad Bunny would likely do the same at the Super Bowl, the Cuban artist filled the Pool Deck with infectious grooves and Caribbean warmth."

But the magical moment came after the official show. Cimafunk appeared at **"The Spot,"** an informal jam space, where he freestyled in Spanish over grooves from the band The Sweet Lillies, weaving in Parliament's *"P-Funk"* and bits of Snoop Dogg, culminating in a communal singalong of *"Hey Jude."*

## The Maroon Legacy

Cimafunk represents more than good music. He's the **living connection between Cuba's African roots and the African-American diaspora**. His music proves that funk and Afro-Cuban rhythms are sibling genres separated by geography but united by ancestral rhythm.

In an era when Cuba faces enormous challenges, artists like Cimafunk carry Cuban culture to the world with pride, creativity, and innovation. From Pinar del Río to New Orleans, from Havana to the world's most prestigious stages, the modern maroon keeps dancing, resisting, and triumphing.
