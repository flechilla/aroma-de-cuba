faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between Cuban fufú and Puerto Rican mofongo?"
    answer: "In Cuban fufú, plantains are boiled before mashing, while mofongo uses fried plantains. Fufú incorporates pork cracklings and mojo criollo; mofongo typically includes chicken broth and mashed garlic."
  - question: "Can you make fufú with ripe plantains?"
    answer: "Traditionally it's made with green plantains, but you can mix in a semi-ripe plantain (pintón) for a slightly sweeter result. Fully ripe plantains create a different texture closer to a sweet purée."
  - question: "What dishes pair well with fufú de plátano?"
    answer: "Fufú works perfectly alongside ropa vieja, chicken fricassee, bistec de palomilla, or any stew with abundant sauce. Its texture soaks up the flavors of the main dish beautifully."
  - question: "Where does the name fufú come from?"
    answer: "The name comes from West Africa, where 'fufu' or 'foofoo' refers to mashed tubers or plantains. It arrived in Cuba with enslaved Africans during the colonial period and adapted to local ingredients."

## From West Africa to the Cuban kitchen

Few dishes tell Cuba's story as honestly as **fufú de plátano**. The name itself is a passport: it comes from [West African fufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufu), where peoples like the Yoruba, Akan, and Igbo pounded yam, cassava, or plantain into a smooth mass to accompany thick soups and stews.

When enslaved Africans arrived in Cuba between the 16th and 19th centuries, they brought this ancestral technique with them. On the island they found plantains in abundance — introduced from the Canary Islands — and adapted their recipe. Cuban fufú was born: **a bridge between two continents**, cooked in the barracks and kitchens of sugar plantations.

## What makes Cuban fufú unique

Unlike its Puerto Rican cousin, [mofongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mofongo) (where plantains are fried), Cuban fufú is made with **boiled green plantains** that are then mashed in a pilón (mortar) or directly in the pot. It's mixed with:

- **Crispy pork cracklings** (check out our [chicharrones de puerco cubanos](/en/blog/2026-02-12-chicharrones-de-puerco-cubanos/) recipe)
- **Garlic** — crushed generously
- **Onion** — sautéed until golden
- **Mojo criollo** with sour orange and cumin
- **Pork or chicken broth** for moisture

The result is a rustic, aromatic mass with irregular chunks of crackling that add salt and texture. It's not elegant — it's **honest**.

## Traditional fufú de plátano recipe

### Ingredients (6 servings)

| Ingredient | Amount |
|---|---|
| Large green plantains | 4 |
| Pork cracklings | 1 cup (crushed) |
| Bacon | 4 strips |
| White onion | 1 large, diced |
| Garlic cloves | 6, crushed |
| Chicken or pork broth | ½ cup |
| Olive oil | 2 tablespoons |
| Salt and pepper | To taste |
| Lime juice or sour orange | 2 tablespoons |

### Instructions

1. **Peel the plantains**: Cut both ends and make a lengthwise slit in the skin. Soak them in hot water for 5 minutes so the peel comes off easily.

2. **Boil**: Cut the plantains into large chunks (not small — to prevent them from absorbing too much water) and boil in salted water for **20-25 minutes** until fork-tender.

3. **Make the sofrito**: While they boil, fry the bacon until crispy. Remove and sauté the onion and garlic in the same fat until golden and fragrant.

4. **Mash**: Drain the plantains and mash with a fork or pilón. Don't aim for a perfectly smooth texture — fufú has character with its lumps.

5. **Combine**: Fold in the sautéed onion and garlic, crushed cracklings, crumbled bacon, warm broth, and lime juice. Mix vigorously.

6. **Serve**: Hot, in a bowl or as a side. A drizzle of mojo criollo on top is the perfect finishing touch.

### Kitchen secrets

- **The pilón makes a difference**: If you have a traditional [wooden mortar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle), use it. The texture it produces is unmatched.
- **Don't skimp on garlic**: Cuban fufú is generous with garlic. Six cloves minimum for four plantains.
- **Semi-ripe plantain**: Mixing one pintón among the green ones adds a subtle sweetness that balances the salt from the cracklings.

## Beyond a side dish

Fufú works spectacularly with saucy main dishes. Try it alongside:

- A [Cuban chicken fricassee](/en/blog/2026-02-12-fricase-de-pollo-cubano/) with its olives and potatoes
- Shredded [ropa vieja](/en/blog/2026-02-10-ropa-vieja-cuban-national-dish-recipe-history/) spooned over the fufú
- A [red bean potaje](/en/blog/2026-02-12-potaje-de-frijoles-colorados-cubano/) ladled alongside
- A [bistec de palomilla](/en/blog/2026-02-12-bistec-de-palomilla-cubano/) with its onions on top

In rural Cuba, especially in the eastern provinces like Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo — where African heritage runs deepest — fufú remains an everyday dish. It's not restaurant food; it's home food, family food, roots food.

## A dish that is identity

Fernando Ortiz, Cuba's great ethnographer, famously used the [ajiaco](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ajiaco-cubano/) as a metaphor for Cuban identity: a mixture of cultures in one pot. Fufú is another perfect example. Every bite holds Africa, Spain, and the Caribbean together. The plantain that the Canary Islanders brought, the technique that enslaved Africans carried, the pork that the colony contributed.

**To eat fufú is to eat history.** And history, in Cuba, always tastes good.
