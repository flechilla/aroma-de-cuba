faq:
  - question: "How many dialysis patients are there in Cuba?"
    answer: "According to official data, approximately 3,000 patients with chronic kidney failure depend on regular hemodialysis treatments on the island."
  - question: "How does the fuel crisis affect kidney patients?"
    answer: "Medical taxis are grounded due to fuel shortages, forcing patients to find their own transportation. Sessions have also been reduced to every other day due to electrical instability."
  - question: "What risks do patients face without regular treatment?"
    answer: "Without hemodialysis every 48 hours, patients with chronic kidney failure accumulate toxins in their blood, which can lead to cardiac complications, pulmonary edema, and death."
  - question: "What alternatives is the Cuban government offering?"
    answer: "Havana's Nephrology Institute has suggested admitting patients when their drivers cannot guarantee transport, but hospital resources are also severely limited."

Cuba's energy crisis isn't just turning off lights and grounding planes — it's directly threatening the lives of thousands of patients who depend on life-sustaining medical treatments. Approximately **3,000 Cubans with chronic kidney failure** face a desperate situation, according to reports from [Martí Noticias](https://www.martinoticias.com/a/pacientes-de-hemodialisis-en-cuba-en-riesgo-por-la-paralizaci%C3%B3n-del-transporte/448110.html) and testimonies gathered by [CubaNet](https://www.cubanet.org/pacientes-de-hemodialisis-en-cuba-sin-transporte-ni-electricidad-como-van-a-sobrevivir/).

## No Fuel, No Ride, No Treatment

Dr. Abel Molina, whose wife — fellow physician Elaine Hernández — has required hemodialysis for the past year, described the situation bluntly: the medical taxis that transport these patients **"have no fuel, they are stationary,"** and many must arrive "by their own means."

Meanwhile, he denounced that **"they continue to sell gasoline in dollars"** and that "government cars are still on the road."

The human cost is immediate. Molina reported paying **2,000 pesos per trip** to transport his wife, and that hemodialysis sessions are being conducted **"every other day"** — a pace nephrologists consider insufficient to keep patients stable.

## The Gap Between Official Promises and Reality

Although authorities [announced emergency measures](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuba-medidas-emergencia-universidades-hospitales/) assuring that essential services would remain unaffected, testimonies on the ground tell a different story.

"That's a lie — there aren't enough supplies or healthcare personnel," Molina declared.

Havana's "Dr. Abelardo Buch López" Nephrology Institute has suggested **admitting patients to the facility** when their drivers cannot guarantee transportation. But this improvised solution runs into the reality of hospitals already operating at their limits, as [we reported on the MINSAP medical brigades](/en/blog/2026-02-10-minsap-reduce-personal-brigadas-medicas-crisis/).

## A Crisis Within the Crisis

Hemodialysis is not optional treatment. Patients with chronic kidney failure need regular sessions — typically three times per week — to filter toxins their kidneys can no longer process. Every missed or delayed session increases the risk of:

- **Hyperkalemia** (excess potassium in blood, can cause cardiac arrest)
- **Pulmonary edema** (fluid buildup in the lungs)
- **Uremic encephalopathy** (brain toxicity)

With [blackouts affecting 56% of the country](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) and the [Ñico López refinery recently catching fire](/en/blog/2026-02-14-incendio-refineria-nico-lopez-habana/), the electrical supply that dialysis machines require is far from guaranteed.

## The Human Cost of the Energy Blockade

This crisis adds to the deterioration of Cuba's healthcare system documented in recent weeks. [Children with cancer already face survival rates dropping](/en/blog/2026-02-11-ninos-cancer-bloqueo-cuba/) from 80% to 65%, and [UN experts have condemned the fuel blockade](/en/blog/2026-02-13-onu-condena-bloqueo-energetico-cuba/) as a form of collective punishment.

For Cuba's 3,000 dialysis patients, the equation is simple and brutal: no fuel means no transport, no electricity means no machines, and no machines means no life.
