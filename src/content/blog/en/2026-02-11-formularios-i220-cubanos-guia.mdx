  - question: "What is Form I-220A?"
    answer: "It's an 'Order of Release on Recognizance' that ICE gives to migrants released from detention. It does not grant legal or permanent immigration status—it only documents that the person was released."
  - question: "What's the difference between I-220A and I-220B?"
    answer: "The I-220A is given to people without a final deportation order who still have pending proceedings. The I-220B (Order of Supervision) is given to those who lost their case in court and have a deportation order but were released under supervision."
  - question: "Can I apply for the Cuban Adjustment Act with an I-220A?"
    answer: "Currently no. The federal government doesn't recognize the I-220A as a legal entry (parole), which prevents applying for the Cuban Adjustment Act. However, there are cases in the courts that could change this interpretation."
  - question: "What should I do if I have an ICE check-in and have an I-220A?"
    answer: "Consult with an immigration attorney BEFORE attending. Some Cubans have been detained during routine check-ins. An attorney can evaluate your case and accompany you if necessary."

Thousands of Cubans in the United States live in uncertainty due to I-220A and I-220B forms. This guide explains what these documents mean, the differences between them, current risks, and available legal options.

## What is Form I-220A?

The **I-220A** or "Order of Release on Recognizance" is a document that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) gives to some people who were detained and then released.

### What it DOES mean:
- You were released from ICE custody
- You must comply with certain conditions (attend hearings, report)
- You have a pending case in immigration court
- You have an "A-Number" to track your case

### What it does NOT mean:
- It does **not** grant you legal immigration status
- It is **not** considered "parole" by the federal government
- It does **not** automatically allow you to apply for the Cuban Adjustment Act
- It does **not** protect you from deportation

## What is Form I-220B?

The **I-220B** or "Order of Supervision" is given to people who:
- Already had a process in immigration court
- Lost their case and have a **final deportation order**
- Were released under supervision while deportation is executed

> ⚠️ **Important:** If you have an I-220B, you technically already have a deportation order. You're on "conditional release" until it's executed.

## Key differences between I-220A and I-220B

| Feature | I-220A | I-220B |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Deportation order | No (generally) | Yes |
| Court process | Pending | Already finished (lost) |
| Immediate risk | Lower | Higher |
| ICE supervision | Variable | Mandatory |
| Possibility of adjustment | Under legal dispute | Very difficult |

## The Problem with the Cuban Adjustment Act

The [Cuban Adjustment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Adjustment_Act) allows Cubans who arrive in the US to apply for permanent residence after one year and one day. **But there's a crucial requirement**: you must have been "admitted or paroled."

The federal government **does not recognize the I-220A as parole**, which means:
- Thousands of Cubans cannot apply for the Adjustment Act
- They remain in "immigration limbo"
- There's no clear path to residence

### The legal case that could change everything

In December 2025, the **11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta** heard arguments about whether the I-220A should be recognized as a legal entry for purposes of the Cuban Adjustment Act.

Attorney **Mark Prada** argued that the releases were improperly processed and should have been recorded as parole.

A favorable ruling could:
- Allow more than 400,000 Cubans to apply for residence
- Establish a national legal precedent
- Change the interpretation of the I-220A

However, the decision could take months and potentially reach the Supreme Court.

## A Case of Hope: Dayan Hernández-Medina

In February 2026, an immigration judge in Arizona approved the **adjustment of status** for Dayan Hernández-Medina, a Cuban with I-220A who faced deportation.

Key points:
- The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated deportation proceedings
- The judge granted Adjustment of Status under INA § 245(a)
- DHS had 30 days to appeal but **did not**
- Hernández is the **first Cuban to obtain residence while detained by ICE** with an I-220A

This case establishes an **important precedent** for other Cubans in similar situations.

## What to do if you have an I-220A

### 1. Consult with an immigration attorney
Don't make decisions without legal advice. Find an attorney experienced in Cuban cases and the Adjustment Act.

### 2. Keep all your documents
- Keep copies of your I-220A
- Preserve evidence of your entry into the country
- Document any communication with ICE

### 3. Comply with your obligations
- Attend all ICE appointments
- Submit all required documents
- Notify address changes

### 4. Consider your options before ICE check-ins
Some Cubans have been **detained during routine appointments**. An attorney can:
- Evaluate if it's safe to attend
- Accompany you to the appointment
- Prepare legal arguments if there are problems

### 5. Follow the legal cases
Cases in the 11th Circuit and 2nd Circuit could change your situation. Stay informed.

## What to do if you have an I-220B

Your situation is more urgent because you already have a deportation order. You should:

1. **Seek an attorney immediately** - Evaluate options like case reopening, habeas corpus, or appeals
2. **Don't miss ICE appointments** - Could result in detention
3. **Explore humanitarian relief** - Asylum, CAT (Convention Against Torture), or cancellation of removal
