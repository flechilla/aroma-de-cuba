The death of **Geraldo Lunas Campos**, a 55-year-old Cuban father, has shocked the immigrant community after the El Paso County medical examiner classified his death as homicide, contradicting ICE's official version of events.

## The facts

Lunas Campos died on **January 3, 2026**, while detained at [Camp East Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_East_Montana), an ICE detention center located in El Paso, Texas. Initially, immigration authorities reported that he had experienced a "medical emergency" after becoming "disruptive."

However, the official autopsy revealed a very different reality: **Geraldo died from asphyxia due to neck and torso compression**, according to the El Paso County medical examiner.

## Key witness testimony

An eyewitness account of the incident completely contradicts ICE's version. According to this testimony:

- Geraldo was **handcuffed** during the altercation
- **At least five guards** held him down on the ground
- **One guard squeezed his neck** until he was unconscious
- Guards blocked access to medical personnel after the incident

This evidence led the medical examiner to classify the death as homicide, not as a natural medical emergency or suicide as later suggested by the Department of Homeland Security.

## A systemic crisis

Geraldo's death is not an isolated case. Camp East Montana has become a focal point of the human rights crisis in the immigration detention system:

### Recent deaths at the facility

- **Geraldo Lunas Campos** (Cuba, 55 years old) - January 3, 2026: Homicide by asphyxia
- **Victor Manuel Díaz** (Nicaragua, 36 years old) - January 14, 2026: Death in custody
- A third detainee died in December 2025

**Three deaths in 44 days** have made this facility the deadliest in the ICE detention system.

### Documented conditions

Organizations like the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/detained-immigrants-detail-physical-abuse-and-inhumane-conditions-at-largest-immigration-detention-center-in-the-u-s) and [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/estados-unidos-nuevas-investigaciones-revelan-violaciones-de-derechos-humanos-en-los-centros-de-detencion-de-alligator-alcatraz-y-krome-en-florida/) have documented:

- Extreme overcrowding
- Lack of adequate medical care
- Physical abuse by guards
- Limited access to legal representation
- Recently reported tuberculosis cases

## The national pattern

January 2026 set a grim record: **six people died in ICE custody** in a single month, surpassing the already alarming numbers from 2025. According to the [American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-deaths-shootings-2026/), 2026 is on track to exceed the record for deaths in immigration detention.

### Other January 2026 cases

- **Luis Gustavo Núñez Caceres** (Honduras, 42 years old) - Texas
- **Luis Beltran Yanez Cruz** (Honduras, 68 years old) - California  
- **Parady La** (Cambodia, 46 years old) - Pennsylvania
- **Heber Sánchez Domínguez** (Mexico, 34 years old) - Georgia

## Family seeks answers

Geraldo Lunas Campos' children have been left with more questions than answers about their father's death. Despite the medical examiner's classification of homicide, ICE has provided little transparent information about the specific circumstances of the incident.

The contrast between the official narrative of a "medical emergency" and the forensic evidence of homicide by asphyxia has generated public outrage and calls for deeper investigation.

## Calls to action

Local lawmakers and human rights organizations have intensified their demands for:

- **Greater oversight** of ICE operations
- **Clear limits** on the use of force
- **Complete transparency** in death investigations
- **Guaranteed access** to medical care for detainees

The American Immigration Council emphasizes that "these are not isolated incidents" but part of "a frightening pattern of lawlessness and indifference to human life."

## A system in crisis

Geraldo Lunas Campos' death exposes fundamental flaws in the U.S. immigration detention system. When a government institution operates with such impunity that it can cause preventable deaths, urgent and radical reform is required.

For the Cuban community in the United States, this case represents not only a personal tragedy but a warning about the dangers their compatriots face in detention. The fight for justice for Geraldo continues as his family and advocates demand accountability for this homicide.
