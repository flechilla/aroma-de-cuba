The energy crisis paralyzing Cuba has reached the heart of its tourism industry. In recent weeks, international operators and tourists have reported the unexpected closure of several luxury resorts and the forced transfer of guests to other facilities to optimize electricity and fuel consumption.

### The \"Consolidation\" Strategy
Industry sources confirm that the Ministry of Tourism has ordered an **\"infrastructure consolidation strategy.\"** This involves concentrating the few tourists remaining on the island into a smaller number of hotels, allowing for the shutdown of power plants and the closure of entire resort areas operating at minimal occupancy levels.

In **Cayo Santa María**, one of the most important tourism hubs, operations have reportedly been suspended at iconic hotels like the **Meliá Buenavista** and the **Valentin Perla Blanca**. Guests from these centers have been moved to nearby facilities that still have stable supplies.

### Visitor Complaints
The measure has not been without controversy. On platforms like TripAdvisor, several tourists have expressed frustration at being relocated to lower-category hotels or areas far from their original bookings. \"We booked a five-star hotel seeking exclusivity and ended up in a massive hotel with reduced services,\" commented an Argentinian traveler recently relocated.

### Impact in Holguín and Varadero
In the **Holguín** area, the **Playa Pesquero** hotel has become a receiving center for displaced tourists, thanks to its more robust infrastructure. However, even in these \"prioritized\" centers, visitors report buffet limitations and a lack of air conditioning in common areas during peak electricity demand hours.

This situation calls into question the viability of the 2026 high season, as the country struggles to keep the lights on in hotels amidst a national power grid on the verge of total collapse.
