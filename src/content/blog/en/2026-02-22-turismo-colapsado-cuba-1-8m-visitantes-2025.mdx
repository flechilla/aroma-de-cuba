The tourism sector in Cuba, considered for decades the "engine of the economy," ended 2025 with figures confirming a deep and structural crisis. According to the latest data from the **National Office of Statistics and Information (ONEI)**, the country received just **1.81 million international visitors**, marking the worst record in over two decades (excluding the pandemic years).

This figure not only represents a **17.2% drop** compared to 2024 but also places the industry **57% below** its 2018 levels, when Cuba reached an all-time record of 4.7 million tourists.

### A massive failure in projections
The Cuban government, through its Ministry of Tourism (MINTUR), had set an optimistic goal of **2.6 million visitors** for 2025. Missing this target by over 800,000 travelers highlights the national infrastructure's inability to compete in today's Caribbean, especially against destinations like the Dominican Republic and Mexico, both of which broke attendance records in the same period.

### Factors behind the collapse
The downfall is not the result of a single cause but rather a "perfect storm" of internal and external factors:

1.  **Energy and Fuel Crisis**: Massive blackouts affecting 60% of the national territory for much of the year tarnished the destination's image. Recently, airlines like **Air Canada** suspended flights due to the airports' inability to guarantee return fuel.
2.  **U.S. Sanctions**: The tightening of the embargo and Cuba's inclusion on the list of state sponsors of terrorism (which removes ESTA visa eligibility for Europeans visiting the island) has deterred key markets.
3.  **Shortage of Supplies**: Local shortages of food and basic goods have affected service quality even in luxury hotels, leading to viral complaints on platforms like TripAdvisor.

### Critical dependence on Canada
Despite the overall collapse, **Canada** remains the industry's lifeline, contributing **754,000 visitors** (41.5% of the total). However, even this loyal market is showing signs of fatigue due to travel advisories from the Ottawa government and the temporary suspension of key air routes in February 2026.

The Cuban tourism industry now faces a 2026 of total uncertainty, where massive investment in luxury hotels—averaging just 15% occupancy—clashes with a social and economic reality that makes it increasingly difficult to attract international travelers.
