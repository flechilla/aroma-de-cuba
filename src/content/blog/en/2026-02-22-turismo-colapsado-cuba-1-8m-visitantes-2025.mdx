The tourism sector in Cuba, considered for decades the "engine of the economy," ended 2025 with figures confirming a deep and structural crisis. According to the latest data from the **National Office of Statistics and Information (ONEI)**, the country received just **1.81 million international visitors**, marking the worst record in over two decades (excluding the pandemic years).

### A massive failure in projections
The Cuban government had set an optimistic goal of **2.6 million visitors** for 2025. Missing this target by over 800,000 travelers highlights the national infrastructure's inability to compete in today's Caribbean.

### Factors behind the collapse
The downfall is not the result of a single cause but rather a "perfect storm":

1.  **Energy and Fuel Crisis**: Massive blackouts and the inability of airports to guarantee jet fuel led airlines like **Air Canada** to suspend operations.
2.  **U.S. Sanctions**: Tightened restrictions have deterred key markets and complicated logistics.
3.  **Shortage of Supplies**: Local shortages of food and basic goods have affected service quality even in luxury resorts.
