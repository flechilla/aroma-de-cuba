Havana is facing an unprecedented sanitary crisis at the start of March 2026. Extreme fuel shortages have immobilized more than half of the solid waste collection fleet, causing tons of garbage to accumulate on the main streets and residential neighborhoods of the Cuban capital.

### Collapse of Municipal Services

According to recent reports, of the 106 trucks assigned to garbage collection in Havana, only 44 (approximately 41%) are active. The rest remain parked at landfills and transit bases due to the lack of diesel — a direct consequence of the energy blockade gripping the island and the interruption of oil supplies from Venezuela.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. Why is there no fuel for garbage trucks?**
The crisis is due to the suspension of oil shipments from Venezuela and international sanctions that make it difficult for Cuba to purchase fuel on the global market.

**2. Which areas of Havana are most affected?**
Densely populated municipalities such as Central Havana, Old Havana, and Diez de Octubre show the highest garbage accumulations.

**3. What measures is the Cuban government taking?**
The Ministry of Energy and Mines has prioritized fuel for hospitals and emergency services, leaving communal services in the background.

**4. Is there a health risk due to this situation?**
Yes, waste accumulation is an infection source for diseases such as dengue, leptospirosis, and gastrointestinal issues.
