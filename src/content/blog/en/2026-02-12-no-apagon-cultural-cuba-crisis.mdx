faq:
  - question: "Was the Havana Book Fair 2026 cancelled?"
    answer: "It wasn't cancelled but postponed indefinitely. The Ministry of Culture announced that book production will continue in digital and print formats, with community-based book presentations replacing the large-scale fair."
  - question: "What does 'no cultural blackout' mean in Cuba?"
    answer: "It's the Cuban Ministry of Culture's pledge that despite the energy and fuel crisis, artistic activity won't stop. The strategy is decentralization: bringing art to neighborhoods instead of relying on large venues."
  - question: "How does the 2026 crisis affect art education in Cuba?"
    answer: "Cuba's 37 art schools and the University of the Arts (ISA) continue classes with adjusted schedules. Students are redistributed to municipal schools, and ISA adopted hybrid and distance learning."
  - question: "Have Cuban artists responded to crises like this before?"
    answer: "Yes. During the Special Period of the 1990s and the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuban artists reinvented their formats. Community art has deep roots in Cuban cultural tradition and has historically thrived during hardship."

**"There can be no cultural blackout."**

With those words, Cuba's Culture Minister Alpidio Alonso drew a line in the sand. As the island faces its worst [fuel shortage](/en/blog/peso-cubano-minimo-historico/) in decades — triggered by tightened U.S. sanctions under [Trump's new executive orders](/en/blog/rubio-sabotea-negociaciones-cuba/) — the country's cultural life is being reinvented. Not by choice, but by necessity.

## Art Goes to the People

The strategy is straightforward: if people can't come to the theater, the theater comes to them.

In early February 2026, Cuba's Ministry of Culture announced a sweeping reorganization of the national arts program. Large theaters and concert halls, unsustainable under current electricity rationing, are giving way to **community spaces**: neighborhood parks, municipal houses of culture, street corners, and front porches.

In [Havana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana), activities are concentrated in beloved spaces like **John Lennon Park** in Vedado and the **Monkey Farm**, where the celebrated children's theater company [La Colmenita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Colmenita) continues performing. In [Las Tunas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Tunas), the Amancio Rodríguez House of Culture runs its *"Saturday with My People"* program. In [Guantánamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo), young art instructors teach [changüí](/en/blog/changui-guantanamo-raiz-son-cubano/) dancing and music in community workshops.

## The Book Fair: Postponed, Not Dead

The most painful decision was the **postponement of the 34th Havana International Book Fair**, Cuba's largest cultural event. Traditionally held at the historic [Morro-Cabaña fortress complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morro-Caba%C3%B1a_Military_Historical_Park), the fair draws hundreds of thousands of visitors and is, for many Cubans, their only annual chance to buy new books.

The [Cuban Book Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Cubano_del_Libro) pledged that publishing won't stop. The plan includes:

- **Digital publications** to maintain access to literature
- **Limited print editions** with available resources
- **Neighborhood book presentations** as a decentralized alternative
- **Author meetups** in houses of culture and community spaces

The fair had faced disruptions during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Cuba), but this marks the first postponement due to an energy crisis.

## The University of the Arts Adapts

Cuba's **37 art education centers** and the [University of the Arts (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Arts_(Cuba)) — one of Latin America's most prestigious arts institutions — are keeping classes going, but with significant changes:

- **Redesigned schedules** adapted to rolling blackouts
- **Decentralized enrollment**: students integrate into municipal schools
- **Art specialties** taught at company headquarters and cultural institutions
- **ISA daytime courses**: shifted to hybrid learning
- **Graduate programs**: fully remote

It's a model forced by crisis, but one that could leave a lasting positive mark: bringing arts education closer to communities historically far from major cultural centers.

## Precedents: Cuban Art and Crisis

Cuba has a long history of creating under extreme conditions.

During the **Special Period** of the 1990s, when the Soviet Union's collapse left Cuba without its main economic partner, some of the most powerful cultural expressions in Cuban history emerged. [Independent cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Cuba) found new voices, Cuban music reinvented itself with [timba](/en/blog/timba-cubana-musica-explosiva-habana/), and visual art pushed bold new boundaries.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, artists across the island brought concerts to balconies, created digital content, and organized gatherings in courtyards. The response was so remarkable that the Ministry now invokes it as precedent: *"Just as there was an extraordinary response from artists during COVID, there will be one now."*

## Critical Voices

Not everyone welcomes these measures with optimism. Independent voices point out that state-promoted "community art" tends to be controlled art: fragmented, local, and symbolically limited.

The case of **[El Ciervo Encantado](/en/blog/ciervo-encantado-rompe-estado-cubano/)** is telling. This experimental theater group, founded in 1996 and censored in 2024, announced a complete break from state cultural institutions after 30 years. Director Nelda Castillo denounced a systematic policy of exclusion against art that questions power.

Meanwhile, Cuba's [book publishing output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_literature) has plummeted over 70% between 2019 and 2024 according to official data, and the [ICAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Institute_of_Cinematographic_Art_and_Industry) operates at minimal production levels.

## Culture as a Barometer

Cuba's history proves something: when culture goes dark, something far deeper is being lost. And when it resists — even on a street corner, with a guitar and a cajón — something essential survives.

In these days of blackouts and scarcity, the promise of "no cultural blackout" is both a statement of principle and a risky bet. Because Cuban culture doesn't live in ministries or official speeches. It lives in the [son](/en/blog/changui-guantanamo-raiz-son-cubano/) echoing through a Centro Habana doorway, in the poem a teacher recites in the dark, in the [rumba](/en/blog/rumba-cubana-patrimonio-unesco/) that needs no electricity to light up the soul.
