The Cuban community in the United States is experiencing moments of tense calm and renewed hope. Following the recent oral arguments hearing at the **11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami**, the immigration future of approximately 500,000 Cubans who entered the country with Form **I-220A** hangs by a legal thread that could change their lives forever.

This legal battle, focused on whether the I-220A document (Order of Release on Recognizance) should be considered equivalent to a **parole**, is fundamental for these migrants to apply for the **Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA)** and obtain permanent residency.

## What happened at the Miami hearing?

Immigration attorneys, led by figures such as Mark Prada, have argued that releasing Cubans at the border under supervision constitutes, in practice, a legal admission that should open the doors to a Green Card. During the session, judges questioned both the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the consistency of policies applied over the last few years.

While a final decision could take weeks or months to be released, experts agree that the tone of the hearing was more balanced than expected, injecting optimism into families who currently find themselves in a legal "limbo."

## Impact of the current administration

Under the Donald Trump administration, deportation policies have intensified, with repatriation flights to Havana already including individuals with criminal records and others considered "ineligible." In this context, a favorable resolution from the Court would be a vital shield against mass deportation for those who only seek a dignified life in freedom.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is Form I-220A?**  
It is an Order of Release on Recognizance given to migrants detained and then released by border authorities. Currently, it is not considered an official "parole" for applying to the Cuban Adjustment Act.

**2. Why is this 11th Circuit hearing so important?**  
Because a favorable decision would set a legal precedent in Florida and other states under its jurisdiction, allowing thousands of Cubans to apply for permanent residency immediately.

**3. What options do I have if I have an I-220A and my case is in court?**  
Attorneys recommend keeping a political asylum case active as a backup and staying alert to higher court decisions to file motions to close or adjust status if the law changes.

**4. Can I be deported if I have an I-220A?**  
While I-220A implies being under supervision and does not guarantee immunity, current deportation efforts mostly focus on individuals with criminal records. However, the risk exists if status is not legalized.
