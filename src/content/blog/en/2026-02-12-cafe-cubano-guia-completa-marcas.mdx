## The cup that moves Cuba

In Cuba, coffee isn't just a drink — it's a ritual, a social currency, and the fuel that powers eleven million people every morning. From the mountains of the **Sierra Maestra** to the ventanitas of Miami, Cuban coffee is one of the island's most iconic products.

The story begins in **1748**, when José Antonio Gelabert brought the first coffee plant from Santo Domingo. By the 19th century, Cuba was one of the world's largest coffee exporters, with plantations covering the mountains of Oriente, Escambray, and the Sierra del Rosario in Pinar del Río.

Today, while production has decreased significantly, Cuban coffee maintains an international reputation for its intense flavor, robust body, and unmistakable aroma.

## The major Cuban coffee brands

### Cubita — "The coffee of Cuba"

[Cubita](https://www.cubacoffee.co.uk/) is the flagship brand. Its **100% Arabica** beans come from Cuba's eastern mountains and are roasted in the Cuban tradition: dark, intense, with notes of chocolate and tobacco. It's the coffee you'll find in Havana's hotels and Cuba's most exported brand.

### Serrano

Café Serrano comes from the heights of the **Sierra Maestra**, grown between 800 and 1,200 meters of altitude. It's arguably the most balanced Cuban coffee: strong but not aggressive, with medium acidity and a clean finish. Available as whole bean and ground.

### Turquino Montanés

Named after **Pico Turquino** (1,974 meters, Cuba's highest point), this coffee grows in the island's most elevated plantations. 100% Arabica, dark roasted, with a flavor profile that combines intensity with subtlety. The connoisseur's choice.

### Other notable brands

- **Guantanamera** — Eastern region coffee, accessible and robust
- **Morena** — Popular blend within Cuba
- **La Indiana** — Emerging brand with select beans
- **Cohiba Atmosphere** — Premium line associated with the cigar brand
- **Montecristo Delegend** — Another luxury tobacco-coffee collaboration

## Types of Cuban coffee: the essential vocabulary

### Cafecito (Café Cubano)

The classic. An espresso shot prepared with the **espumita** technique: the first drops of coffee are mixed with demerara sugar and whipped vigorously until they form a thick, golden cream. Then the rest of the espresso is poured on top. The result is intense, sweet, and addictive.

### Colada

The social version of the cafecito. It's exactly the same preparation but in a **large quantity** (about 4-6 shots), served in a styrofoam cup with small plastic cups for sharing. In Miami, ordering a colada at the ventanita is a sacred daily ritual.

### Cortadito

Cafecito with a splash of hot **evaporated milk**. It's not a Spanish cortado — the evaporated milk gives it a creamier, sweeter texture. The afternoon favorite.

### Café con leche

Strong coffee mixed with **hot milk** in generous proportions. It's the quintessential Cuban breakfast, especially paired with buttered toast.

## How to make cafecito cubano at home

### You'll need:
- Moka pot (the classic Italian stovetop maker, called "greca" in Cuba)
- Finely ground Cuban coffee (Cubita, Serrano, or Turquino)
- Demerara or turbinado sugar
- A small cup and a spoon

### The method:
1. Fill the moka pot with water up to the valve and add coffee to the filter
2. Put **2-3 teaspoons of sugar** in a cup
3. When the **first drops** of coffee come out, pour them over the sugar
4. **Whip vigorously** with the spoon to create the espumita (it should turn golden and thick)
5. Let the rest of the coffee finish brewing
6. Pour the coffee over the espumita
7. Serve in small cups and share

The secret is in the espumita. If it's too pale, you need more energy when whipping. If it's too dark, you used too much coffee in the initial step.

## Cuban coffee in the diaspora

In **Miami**, Cuban coffee is an institution. The ventanitas on Calle Ocho, [Versailles Restaurant](https://www.versaillesrestaurant.com/), and every corner of Hialeah dispense coladas all day long. It's no exaggeration to say that the cafecito is the social glue of the Cuban-American community.

In **Union City, New Jersey**, Tampa, and every city with a Cuban presence, the tradition lives on. Brands like **Bustelo** and **Pilon** — while not technically Cuban — were born from the Cuban coffee tradition and dominate the US Latin market.
