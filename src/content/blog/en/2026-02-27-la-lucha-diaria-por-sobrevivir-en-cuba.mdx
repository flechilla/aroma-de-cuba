The energy crisis in Cuba has reached a point of no return this February 2026. With a deficit that regularly exceeds 1,700 MW, the daily lives of Cubans—especially the younger generations—have transformed into an extreme exercise in survival and resilience.

## Living Between Blackouts: Testimony of a Generation

For young people born at the end of the "Special Period," the current situation echoes the darkest stories told by their parents, but exacerbated by an aging electrical infrastructure and growing international isolation. "It's not just the lack of power; it's the lack of a future," says a university student in Havana.

Daily routines now revolve around blackout schedules, which in many provinces exceed 15 hours a day. The lack of electricity affects not only comfort but also access to water, refrigeration for scarce food, and connectivity—vital for work and study.

## A System on the Brink of Collapse

The National Electric Union (UNE) has reported critical generation states due to fuel shortages and recurring breakdowns at major power plants such as Guiteras and Felton. Although aid shipments from Mexico and diplomatic gestures from Russia and China have been received, internal demand remains far above actual generation capacity.

### Key Factors of the Current Crisis:
*   **Record Deficit:** The national system barely covers 40-50% of peak demand.
*   **Lack of Maintenance:** Power plants are operating far beyond their intended lifespan.
*   **Fuel Shortages:** The energy blockade has made it difficult for crude oil to reach floating power plants and thermal stations.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the current electrical deficit in Cuba?
In February 2026, the deficit has fluctuated between 1,500 MW and 1,800 MW, representing more than half of the national demand during peak hours.

### How do blackouts affect basic services?
The lack of power paralyzes water pumping, healthcare services (except for hospitals with priority generators), and the distribution of rationed food.

### Are there short-term solutions?
The government is betting on the installation of solar parks and humanitarian aid from allied countries, but experts agree that a massive structural investment is required—something the current economy cannot afford.

### What do young people say about their future on the island?
Many see emigration as the only way out given the lack of stability and the dismal living conditions caused by the energy and economic crisis.
