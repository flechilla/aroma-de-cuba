faq:
  - question: "Can Cuban private businesses import fuel?"
    answer: "Yes. Since February 2026, Cuba allows private and foreign companies on the island to import fuel for their own use in T11 isotanks, though resale is prohibited."
  - question: "What are T11 isotanks used for diesel imports?"
    answer: "They are stainless steel cylindrical tanks holding 21,000 to 26,000 liters that fit into standard cargo container frames and can be transported on any cargo ship."
  - question: "Do U.S. sanctions affect these private fuel imports?"
    answer: "It's unclear. Trump's executive order targets countries selling oil 'to Cuba' but doesn't specify whether that includes the private sector. Sources say Washington may tolerate these shipments."
  - question: "What tax incentives does Cuba offer for renewable energy?"
    answer: "Resolution 41/2026 exempts income or profit taxes for up to eight years for investments in renewable energy systems, and eliminates customs duties on solar panels, batteries, and inverters."

In an unprecedented shift in Cuba's economic history, **private businesses have begun importing fuel directly** to the island, breaking a state monopoly that lasted over six decades. The move comes amid a [deepening energy crisis](/en/blog/2026-02-17-cuba-oscurece-imagenes-satelitales-caida-luz) caused by the U.S. oil blockade.

## The End of the State Fuel Monopoly

According to [EFE via OnCubaNews](https://oncubanews.com/cuba/economia/emprendimientos/el-sector-privado-en-cuba-ya-comenzo-a-importar-combustible-a-la-isla-una-bocanada-de-aire/), the Cuban government has held meetings with foreign entrepreneurs and local business owners to explain how private fuel imports can work.

The opening makes good on a November 2025 announcement by Foreign Trade Minister Oscar Pérez-Oliva, who said private and mixed enterprises would **"shortly"** be allowed to import their own fuel.

### How does it work?

- Fuel is transported in **T11 stainless steel isotanks** (21,000–26,000 liters capacity)
- The containers fit on any standard cargo vessel
- Imports are processed through a state importing agency
- Extra safety certifications are required for hazardous materials
- Fuel is **strictly for self-consumption** — resale is banned

## A Lifeline or a Drop in the Bucket?

The volumes involved are modest. Cuba needs roughly **110,000 barrels per day** of oil (40,000 from domestic wells). Private imports can't fill the national gap, but they can keep specific businesses running.

Several U.S.-based companies already hold **specific licenses to export diesel in isotanks to Cuba**, but only for private customers. Some entrepreneurs are also exploring purchases from other countries in the region.

### The Sanctions Gray Zone

Trump's [January 29 executive order](/en/blog/2026-02-16-eeuu-evalua-envio-combustible-cuba) imposes tariffs on "goods imported into the United States that are products of any other country that directly or indirectly sells or in any way provides oil to Cuba." But it doesn't specify whether Cuba's private sector is included.

EFE asked the U.S. Embassy in Havana for clarification; the embassy simply referred back to the original text. However, sources involved in the trade say they've received **"signals" of tolerance** from Washington.

The British weekly [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) recently reported that the U.S. administration is considering allowing limited fuel supplies into the island for basic needs.

## Cuba Also Offers 8-Year Tax Breaks for Renewables

In another significant measure published Thursday, **Resolution 41/2026** from the Ministry of Finance and Prices establishes [tax exemptions of up to eight years](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2026-02-20-u1-e135253-s27061-nid321289-gobierno-exonera-ocho-anos-impuestos-privados) for renewable energy investments:

- **Income or profit tax exemption** during the investment recovery period (maximum 8 years)
- **Customs duty elimination** for solar panels, wind generators, biodigesters, photovoltaic pumps, and components
- Individuals can import this equipment **without it counting toward non-commercial import limits**
- Authorization to **sell surplus energy** to the National Grid

This follows Cuba's [record 800 MW solar generation](/en/blog/2026-02-12-record-solar-cuba-800-mw) achievement, showing the island's renewable potential.

## The Context: An Economy on the Edge

These openings arrive as Cuba faces its worst crisis in decades:

- **15% GDP decline** over the past five years
- Over **20% of the population** has emigrated
- [Hospitals on minimal services](/en/blog/2026-02-10-minsap-reduce-personal-brigadas-medicas-crisis)
- Public transportation virtually nonexistent
- [Ration system subsidies ending](/en/blog/2026-02-19-cuba-canasta-normada-sin-subsidios-abril) in April

Whether these measures represent genuine economic opening or desperate concessions remains to be seen. What's clear is that **the state monopoly on fuel has cracked** — and in Cuba, that's historic.
