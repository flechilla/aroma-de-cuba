faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between potaje and Cuban black beans?"
    answer: "Potaje de frijoles colorados is a thicker stew that includes root vegetables like pumpkin, potato, and sweet potato, while Cuban black beans are served as a thinner, more soup-like dish. Red bean potaje also uses a more elaborate sofrito and often includes pork."
  - question: "How long should you soak red beans for Cuban potaje?"
    answer: "Soak them for 8 to 12 hours (overnight) in cold water. This cuts cooking time in half and improves texture. For a quick method, boil them for 2 minutes, then let them rest covered for 1 hour."
  - question: "What root vegetables go in Cuban potaje?"
    answer: "The classic trio is calabaza (tropical pumpkin), potato, and boniato (white sweet potato). The calabaza is essential because it breaks down during cooking and naturally thickens the broth. Some families add green plantain or malanga."
  - question: "Can you make potaje de frijoles colorados in a pressure cooker?"
    answer: "Yes, a pressure cooker reduces cooking time from 2-3 hours to about 30-40 minutes. Cook the soaked beans for 20 minutes under pressure first, then add the vegetables and sofrito to finish without the lid."

# Potaje de Frijoles Colorados: Cuba's Most Comforting Red Bean Stew

If there's one dish that defines the everyday Cuban lunch, it's **potaje de frijoles colorados**. It doesn't have the international fame of the [mojito](/en/blog/2026-02-10-cuban-mojito-history-perfect-recipe/) or the festive glamour of [lechón asado](/en/blog/2026-02-11-lechon-asado-cubano/), but ask any Cuban what food they miss most and the answer is almost always: *"a good potaje with white rice."*

## A Dish Born from Necessity and Ingenuity

Red kidney beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) arrived in Cuba with Spanish colonizers, but it was Creole creativity that transformed them into potaje. Unlike the [fabadas of Asturias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabada_asturiana) that inspired them, Cuban potaje incorporated tropical root vegetables — pumpkin, sweet potato, green plantain — and the sofrito criollo that forms the foundation of all [Cuban cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_cuisine).

During the **Special Period** of the 1990s, red bean potaje became the undisputed star of the Cuban table. With meat scarce, families stretched a pound of beans with backyard root vegetables to feed the entire household. The potaje didn't just fill stomachs: **it filled souls**.

## The Recipe for Perfect Potaje

### Ingredients (serves 6-8)

- 1 pound (450 g) dried red kidney beans
- 200 g pork (ribs, bacon, or pork chunks)
- 1 medium calabaza/tropical pumpkin (about 300 g), peeled and cubed
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 medium boniato (white sweet potato), peeled and cubed
- 1 large green bell pepper
- 1 large onion
- 6 garlic cloves
- 3 tablespoons oil (preferably olive oil)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar or dry cooking wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A pinch of sugar (optional — a Cuban grandmother's secret)

### Step-by-Step Preparation

**1. Soaking and cooking the beans**

Soak the beans overnight (8-12 hours) in cold water. Drain, place in a large pot with fresh water covering them by about 3 inches. Add the bay leaves and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the flame and cook covered for **1.5 to 2 hours** until tender but not mushy.

**2. The sofrito criollo**

In a separate pan, heat the oil and sauté the diced onion until translucent. Add the crushed garlic, diced pepper, cumin, and oregano. Cook 3-4 minutes until the aroma fills the kitchen. This sofrito is the **heart of the potaje**.

**3. Bringing it together**

Add the sofrito to the pot with the beans. Add the pork, pumpkin, potato, and sweet potato. The calabaza is key: as it cooks, it partially breaks down and gives the broth its signature **creamy texture**.

**4. Final cooking**

Cook over medium heat for another 30-40 minutes. The pumpkin will have dissolved to thicken the broth, the potatoes will be tender, and the pork will have released all its flavor. Add the vinegar, salt, pepper, and that pinch of sugar Cuban grandmothers never forget.

## How to Serve Cuban Potaje

The classic presentation is unmistakable: **white rice** mounded in the center of the plate with the potaje ladled around it, forming a volcano of flavor. Many families add a [bistec de palomilla](/en/blog/2026-02-12-bistec-de-palomilla-cubano/) on the side or avocado slices when in season.

Perfect accompaniments include:
- [Tostones](/en/blog/2026-02-11-tostones-cubanos/) or [sweet plantains](/en/blog/2026-02-12-platanos-maduros-fritos-cubanos/)
- Avocado salad with onion and lime
- Cuban bread for dipping in the broth

## Potaje in Cuban Culture

In Cuba, every family has **their** potaje recipe, passed down through generations. The differences spark passionate debates: with or without pumpkin? Potato or sweet potato? Pork or jerked beef? Vinegar or dry wine?

Potaje transcends cooking. It's the dish of family reunions, of domino afternoons, of comfort after a bad day. As Cuban novelist [Leonardo Padura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Padura) has observed: Cuban food tells the story of a people who learned to make much from little.

## Regional Variations

- **Eastern Cuba (Santiago, Guantánamo):** Spicier, with ají cachucha peppers and sometimes green plantain
- **Havana:** The classic version with pumpkin and potato
- **Camagüey:** Known for adding Spanish chorizo when available
- **Rural Cuba:** Made with tasajo (dried salted beef) instead of fresh pork

## Tips from a Cuban Cook

1. **Never add salt at the beginning** — it toughens the beans during cooking
2. **Always crush the garlic**, never mince it fine — it releases more essential oils
3. **Cook over low heat** — patience is the secret ingredient
4. **Potaje tastes better the next day** — the flavors concentrate as it rests
