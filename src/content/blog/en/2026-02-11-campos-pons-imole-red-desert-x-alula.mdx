In the heart of the [AlUla](https://www.experiencealula.com/) desert, among rock formations that have witnessed seven thousand years of human civilization, a work blooms that connects Afro-Cuban traditions with Saudi Arabia's ancestral landscape. **María Magdalena Campos-Pons**, one of the most influential Cuban artists of her generation, presents *Imole Red* as part of [Desert X AlUla 2026](https://desertx.org/).

## From Matanzas to the World

Campos-Pons was born in 1959 in La Vega, a small town in Matanzas province, where she grew up on a sugar plantation surrounded by traditions inherited from her Nigerian, Hispanic, and Chinese ancestors. Her work explores **memory, identity, and the African diaspora** through photography, video, performance, and monumental installations.

> "I collect and tell stories of forgotten people in order to foster a dialogue to better understand and propose a poetic, compassionate reading of our time."
> — María Magdalena Campos-Pons

In 2023, she received the **MacArthur Fellowship** —known as the "genius grant"— recognition that places her among the world's most important artists. Her work is in the collections of [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/), [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/), the [Smithsonian American Art Museum](https://americanart.si.edu/), and the Getty Museum.

## Imole Red: Light in the Desert

*Imole* means "light" in Yoruba, the language of her Nigerian ancestors brought to Cuba as slaves. The installation unfolds as a sculptural garden of **giant stylized plants in intense red tones** that dialogue with the Saudi desert sunsets.

The work explores how landscapes that are now desert were once seas, preserving the **memory of water and the promise of connection**. It's a bridge between Cuban Santería and the mysticism of the ancient AlUla oasis, where caravans traded incense millennia ago.

## Desert X AlUla 2026: The Art of the Land

The fourth edition of Desert X AlUla, under the theme *Space Without Measure*, brings together eleven international artists whose works transform the valley into an open-air museum. The exhibition, co-curated by **Wejdan Reda** and **Zoé Whitley**, is open through **February 28, 2026**.

Other installations include:
- **The Living Pyramid** by Agnes Denes, a living pyramid of desert plants
- **The Water Song** by Tarek Atoui, an underground sound composition
- **Haraza Tree** by Ibrahim El-Salahi, a sculptural forest inspired by acacia trees

## A Legacy That Crosses Oceans

Campos-Pons represents the continuity of the [New Cuban Art movement](/en/blog/nueva-trova-cubana-revolucion-hecha-cancion/), which emerged in the 1980s as a response to cultural restrictions on the island. She emigrated to the United States in 1991 and is now a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Her presence at Desert X AlUla confirms that Cuban art knows no borders. From a sugar plantation in Matanzas to the canyons of Saudi Arabia, the stories of the African diaspora find new territories where they can bloom.
