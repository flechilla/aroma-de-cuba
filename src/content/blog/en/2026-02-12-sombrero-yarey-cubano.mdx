## The Hat That Tells Cuba's Story

If one garment defines the **Cuban farmer**, it's the yarey hat. Wide-brimmed, light as a breeze, and cool under the relentless Caribbean sun, this hat isn't just an accessory — it's a symbol of national identity that has accompanied Cuba since its earliest days.

The [mambises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambi) wore it during the wars of independence with the Cuban cockade. *Guajiros* (farmers) have used it for generations to shield themselves from the sun in sugarcane and tobacco fields. Today, tourists and Cubans alike wear it as an emblem of *cubanía*.

## Origin: Camajuaní, Cradle of Yarey

The yarey hat was born in **[Camajuaní](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camajuan%C3%AD)**, a municipality in Villa Clara province, in the heart of Cuba. Cultural and sociological research traces it to this central region, where farmers first began weaving fibers from the [yarey palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicia) (*Copernicia yarey*) into practical, affordable hats.

The yarey palm — also called **guano** — is an endemic species that grows abundantly across Cuban plains and savannas. From its leaves come the fibers that give life to this unique hat.

## The Art of Weaving Yarey

Making a yarey hat is an artisanal process passed down through generations:

### Harvesting

Yarey leaves are preferably cut **at night during a waning moon**, following a farming tradition believed to ensure greater fiber flexibility. They're left to mature for about ten days before working.

### Preparation

The leaves are split into **thin strips** and sorted by quality and thickness. The finest fibers produce tighter braids and more valuable hats.

### Weaving

The strips are braided into long strands that are then **sewn in a spiral**, shaping the crown and brim. Only three tools are needed: yarey fibers, strong thread, and a large needle.

### Finishing

The hat may feature colored ribbons around the crown base, be dyed or left in its natural straw color. Some artisans add pins, flowers, or decorative designs.

## More Than a Hat: Intangible Heritage

The yarey hat isn't just any garment. Along with other [crafts from central Cuba](/en/blog/2026-02-12-artesania-cubana-guia-productos-artesanales/), it was declared **intangible national heritage** — recognizing the knowledge, skills, and customs it represents.

It fuses past and present, speaking to:

- The **economic and social origins** of rural Cuba
- **Artisanal skills** passed through generations
- **Rural customs** that define campesino identity
- The **resourcefulness** of a people who transform nature into art

## Varieties and Styles

Not all yarey hats are the same. Artisans craft them in multiple styles:

| Style | Features | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Classic farmer** | Wide, straight brim, tall crown | Agricultural work |
| **Dress** | Moderate brim, fine finish | Country fiestas, outings |
| **Women's** | Upturned brim, flower decorations | Daily wear, events |
| **Tourist** | Colored ribbons, smaller size | Souvenir, fashion |

Beyond hats, the same weaving technique produces **baskets, handbags, fans, and placemats** — an entire artisanal industry built around the yarey palm.

## Yarey in Cuban Culture

### In Music

The yarey hat stars in countless country songs. The celebrated [Cándido Fabré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1ndido_Fabr%C3%A9) immortalized the line *"¿Quién ha visto por ahí mi sombrero de yarey?"* (Who's seen my yarey hat?), and in [punto cubano](/en/blog/2026-02-12-punto-cubano-decima-patrimonio-unesco/) — a UNESCO heritage tradition — the hat is the improvising poet's inseparable prop.

### In the Wars of Independence

The mambises adopted the yarey hat as part of their improvised uniform during the wars against Spain (1868-1898). They decorated it with the **Cuban cockade** — a symbol of rebellion that turned a peasant garment into an emblem of freedom.

### In the 20th Century

The 1959 Peasant Rally in Havana brought hundreds of thousands of yarey hats to the capital, creating one of the most iconic images of revolutionary Cuba.

## Where to Buy Yarey Hats

### In Cuba
- **Havana Craft Market** (by the harbor): Wide variety of styles and prices
- **Trinidad**: Local artisans sell directly on the cobblestone streets
- **Camajuaní, Villa Clara**: The birthplace of yarey, where you'll find the most authentic hats
- **ANAP Fairs** (National Association of Small Farmers): Direct campesino products

### Abroad
- **Miami, Calle Ocho**: Cuban craft shops
- **[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=cuban+straw+hat)**: Independent artisans sell hand-woven hats
- **Latin markets**: In cities with Cuban communities like Union City, NJ and Houston, TX

## Care and Conservation

To make your yarey hat last for years:

1. **Store in a cool, dry place** — excess humidity can cause mold
2. **Don't crush it** — place it upside down or on a hat stand
3. **Clean with a damp cloth** — yarey can be gently washed
4. **Avoid prolonged water exposure** — while resistant, excess water weakens the fibers
5. **Reshape with steam** if it loses its form — yarey is malleable

## A Living Legacy

In an era of factory hats and imported caps, the yarey hat survives as testimony to the relationship between Cubans and their land. Each hand-woven hat carries centuries of tradition, the aroma of the Cuban countryside, and the skill of hands that refuse to let an art form die.

As [José Martí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Martí) wrote: *"I am a child of the Americas, and to them I owe myself."* The yarey hat is a child of Cuba — of its palms, its farmers, and its history — and to Cuba it belongs.
