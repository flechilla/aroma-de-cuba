# Roberto Salas: The Eye That Captured the Revolution

Cuba has just crowned one of its most extraordinary visual chroniclers. **Roberto Salas**, the Cuban-American photographer whose lens immortalized defining moments of 20th-century Cuba, has been awarded the **2025 National Prize for Visual Arts**.

The recognition comes after six decades of tireless work, from the Sierra Maestra mountains to the halls of the United Nations, through the battlefields of Vietnam.

## An Encounter That Changed Everything

Roberto Salas's story with Cuba began almost by chance. In 1955, at just 15 years old, he accompanied his father [Osvaldo Salas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osvaldo_Salas)—a renowned photographer whose images appeared in *Life* and *The New York Times*—to document a group of Cuban activists in Havana.

One of those activists was a young lawyer named **Fidel Castro**.

> "He was a magnet for cameras, for photographers," Salas recalls about that encounter that would define his career.

When Castro launched his revolutionary movement in 1956, the Salases—father and son—were invited to document it. Thus began a privileged access that no other photographer of the era had.

## Images That Defined an Era

Roberto Salas's photographs aren't mere historical documents; they're intimate portraits of a transformative moment:

- **Castro and Hemingway (1960)**: The only photographic record of the meeting between the Cuban leader and the Nobel laureate
- **Castro at the UN, New York (1960)**: The dramatic visit that captured worldwide attention
- **The Bay of Pigs (1961)**: Visual testimony of one of the Cold War's tensest moments
- **"La Bandera y la Señora" (1957)**: His first image published in *Life*, which catapulted him to international recognition

Art critic Rafael Acosta de Arriba wrote about him: *"Roberto Salas, witness of his time, belongs to a select group of photographers who have contributed to Cuban photography being considered art."*

## Beyond Cuba

Salas's talent wasn't limited to his island of origin. He was a war correspondent in Vietnam, where his work earned him the **Medal of Friendship** from the Vietnamese Council of Ministers.

He also received:
- **First Prize for Sports Photography**, Reus, Spain (1970)
- **Asahi Shimbun International Photographic Salon Prize**, Tokyo, Japan

He is a founding member of both the [Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba (UNEAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni%C3%B3n_de_Escritores_y_Artistas_de_Cuba) and the Union of Cuban Journalists (UPEC).

## The Master's Philosophy

From his father, he learned not only technique but philosophy. When asked about his favorite photograph, Osvaldo Salas would reply: *"I'm going to take it tomorrow."*

Roberto thought it was just a clever line. After his father's death in 1992, he understood it was a concept: *"You can always do better."*

## A Well-Deserved Prize

The jury for the 2025 National Prize for Visual Arts included prominent figures from Cuban art, including Margarita Ruiz, Nelson Herrera Ysla, and Manuel Hernández (2024 National Prize winner).

Their decision was unanimous: Roberto Salas has elevated Cuban photography to the level of universal art.

*At 85, Roberto Salas continues to prove what he always believed: the best photo is yet to be taken.*
