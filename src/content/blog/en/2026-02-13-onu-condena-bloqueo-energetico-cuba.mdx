Three experts and rapporteurs from the UN Human Rights Council condemned on Thursday the energy blockade the United States has imposed on Cuba, calling it a **"grave violation of international law"** that may constitute collective punishment against the civilian population.

## An Unambiguous Condemnation

The rapporteurs — George Katrougalos (expert on democratic and equitable international order), Ben Saul (rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism), and Michael Fakhri (rapporteur on the right to food) — issued a categorical statement from Geneva.

> "There is no justification under international law for imposing economic sanctions on third states for engaging in legitimate exchanges with another sovereign state."

The experts noted that [Trump's January 29 executive order](https://apnews.com/article/oil-cuba-tariffs-trump-mexico-30f1d74a766fee23001684a5bb8079d9), which threatens tariffs on any country selling oil to Cuba, **lacks UN Security Council authorization** and violates the principles of sovereign equality, non-intervention, and self-determination enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

## The Humanitarian Crisis on the Ground

The rapporteurs' statement went beyond legal arguments, documenting direct consequences for the population:

- **Power outages exceeding 20 hours** in many areas
- Impact on **food and medicine refrigeration**
- Disruption of **hospitals, public transit, and water systems**
- Contributing to a **generalized public health crisis**

The designation of Cuba as an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to US security was called lacking in credibility by the rapporteurs, who said it "appears designed to justify the extraordinary use of coercive powers."

## Mexico Responds with Action

While diplomacy speaks, aid arrives by sea. On Thursday, [two Mexican Navy ships docked in Havana](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cuba-humanitarian-aid-havana-us-sanctions-52c44db94c9423511d67366662e78ac4) carrying **more than 800 tons of humanitarian aid**: powdered milk, rice, beans, sardines, meat products, vegetable oil, and hygiene supplies.

President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she will send more support as soon as the ships return, including an additional 1,500 tons of beans and powdered milk.

## International Flotilla in the Works

Meanwhile, the Progressive International announced the organization of the **Flotilla Nuestra América**, set to depart next month from multiple countries with food, medicine, and supplies. According to coordinator David Adler, the initiative aims to be "a political call to the governments of the region" and already has activists from Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and Chile.

## An Escalating Pattern

The UN condemnation joins [Russia's criticism](/en/blog/2026-02-10-russia-declares-cuba-situation-critical-accuses-us/), [China's cautious response](/en/blog/2026-02-12-china-arroz-petroleo-cuba/), and mounting international diplomatic pressure. With [64% of the country without electricity](/en/blog/2026-02-12-apagon-record-64-porciento-cuba/) and airlines from [Canada](/en/blog/2026-02-11-canada-turismo-cuba-crisis/), [Russia](/en/blog/2026-02-11-rusia-suspende-vuelos-cuba/), and other countries suspending flights, Cuba's crisis has moved beyond a bilateral issue to become a global flashpoint.

The rapporteurs urged the US government to **immediately revoke the executive order** and halt the use of extraterritorial economic measures. As of now, Washington has not responded to the statement.
